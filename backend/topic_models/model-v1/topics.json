          " Human error and design flaws contributed to the crash.\n        \n            [INST]\n            I have a topic that contains the following documents:\n            - The FDR and CVR are crucial for understanding what happened during those final moments. Without them, investigators must rely on other evidence to piece together the events leading up to the crash. Witness reports have indicated that the landing gear was initially deployed during the final approach, with flaps extended, but at some point, both were retracted\u2014a standard procedure in a go-around maneuver. The CVR would have provided insights into why the crew decided to abort their initial landing attempt and whether there was an issue with one or both engines. It could also reveal if the thrust reversers were functioning correctly. These answers are vital not only for satisfying curiosity but also for preventing future tragedies. If the crash resulted from mechanical failure, identifying the cause could save lives in the future. Conversely, if pilot error was to blame, new training procedures could be implemented. A similar situation occurred near Colorado Springs in 1991 with United Flight 585. For years, investigators couldn't determine what caused it, and suspicion fell upon the flight crew for a seemingly perfect 737 suddenly crashing into the ground. Three years later, another 737 crashed on approach to Pittsburgh under similar circumstances. Initially, people were quick to conclude that the pilots might have inadvertently or even in panic stepped on the wrong rudder pedal. However, test pilots and simulators could recover from such scenarios every single time, raising questions about why these crews couldn't. It was only after investigators recovered the Rudder Power Control Unit (RPCU) that they discovered the fluid remains very cold at altitude, and then on descent, hot hydraulic fluid in a few cases caused the unit to seize and deflect in the opposite direction commanded by the pilots. In the stop-in-reversal scenario postulated by the NTSB, the pilot makes a high-rate rudder command to the left; the primary valve extends to its travel limit and should be followed by a movement of the secondary valve. However, the secondary slide jams to the outer case, allowing the primary valve to overtravel, resulting in a misalignment of the hydraulic ports. This allows hydraulic flow in the wrong direction and causes the rudder actuator rod to retract rather than extend, moving the rudder in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots. Boeing disagreed with these findings, claiming it was still pilot error. The FAA initially agreed but then changed",

The global population growth rate has slowed down since the 1960s, but the total number of people keeps increasing. The main drivers of population growth are high fertility rates in some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and improvements in healthcare and living standards globally.\n            - The world's population is growing rapidly, and this growth puts pressure on natural resources, infrastructure, and services. The strain on the planet's resources is evident in various forms, including climate change, deforestation, water scarcity, and pollution. The consequences of unchecked population growth are far-reaching and devastating, affecting not only human well-being but also the health of ecosystems and biodiversity.\n            - The world's population is projected to peak at around 9.7 billion in the middle of the century and then decline slowly. This projection is based on medium-fertility assumptions, which assume that fertility rates will decrease gradually over time. However, there are uncertainties surrounding this projection, and actual population trends may differ from the projections.\n            - The world's population is projected to increase by 2 billion people between 2023 and 2050, with the majority of this growth occurring in developing regions. This rapid population growth poses significant challenges for sustainable development, resource management, and environmental protection.\n            - The world's population is aging, and this demographic shift has significant implications for social security systems, pension plans, and healthcare services. As people live longer, they require more care and support, putting pressure on family members and caregivers. Governments must adapt their policies to address the needs of an aging population and ensure that they receive adequate care and support.\n\n            The topic is described by the following keywords: 'population, growth, world, projected, billion, 2050, 2100, drivers, fertility, healthcare, living, standards, rate, slowing, strain, resources, climate, change, deforestation, water, scarcity, pollution, consequences, well-being, ecosystems, biodiversity, peak, decline, slow, uncertainties, assumptions, developing, regions, challenges, sustainable, development, resource, management, environmental, protection, aging, demographic, shift, implications, social, security",

However, despite\n              advances in medicine and technology, many countries are facing\n              challenges in improving life expectancy due to various factors\n              including lifestyle choices, environmental pollution, and access\n              to healthcare services.\n            - The WHO defines life expectancy as the average number of years\n              a newborn can expect to live if current mortality rates continue\n              throughout their lifetime.\n            - Life expectancy varies significantly across different regions\n              and countries. For example, Japan has the highest life expectancy\n              at birth at 84.7 years, followed closely by Singapore at 85.4\n              years. On the other hand, some African countries like Chad and\n              Central African Republic have life expectancy at birth as low as\n              around 53 years.\n            - Factors contributing to variations in life expectancy include\n              socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, education level,\n              lifestyle choices, and environmental pollution.\n            - Despite the challenges, there are opportunities for improvement.\n              Governments, health organizations, and individuals can work\n              together to address the root causes of declining life expectancy\n              and promote healthy lifestyles, improve access to healthcare,\n              and reduce environmental pollution.\n            - The concept of life expectancy is complex and multifaceted,\n              involving various social, economic, and environmental factors.\n              Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective\n              strategies to improve life expectancy.\n\n            The topic is described by the following keywords: 'life expectancy, world health organization, who, japan, singapore, chad, central african republic, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, education level, lifestyle choices, environmental pollution'.\n\n            Based on the information about the topic above, please identify\n            causes for the issue and create a short english label of this\n            topic emphasizing the cause.

Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to serious complications if left untreated or poorly managed.\n            - The increasing prevalence of diabetes is attributed to several factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and genetic predisposition.

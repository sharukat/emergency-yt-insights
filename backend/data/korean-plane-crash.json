This video shows an Air Canada Express flight on its side being hosed down by firefighters in Halifax, Nova Scotia after the plane had a landing gear problem upon touchdown. The crew and 73 passengers got out safely. In Norway, a km 737 was diverted after the crew heard a loud noise shortly after takeoff from Oslo. The plane landed in Torp and veered off the runway at a low speed; there were no injuries. Let's go ahead and bring in ABC News contributor and aviation consultant Colonel Steve Ganard. Good morning, thank you so much for being here. Let's start with that South Korean crash. Authorities are pointing to this bird strike. We know that there were 5 minutes of video data lost just before they landed and crashed. What does that tell you? Did the pilots have enough time to deploy the landing gear? When we look at these mishaps, there are often clues early on in the mishap that would point us to an idea of what might have happened. We did see a video that appears to show that they ingested a bird into the right engine; however, we don't know if there were other birds that hit the aircraft or if there was any damage to the aircraft. Why did they land with the gear up? When you look at the airplane as it goes by the camera, you can see the slats and flaps are up, so they landed very fast; they touched down way down the runway. Why was it going so fast when they had almost 2 miles of runway that they could have touched down earlier? Many mysteries here.","comments":["0: Boeing is in serious trouble again , a Dutch airplane KLM had engine blowing up just like juju airplane . https://youtu.be/IRlW2BxoXXA?si=Fha8kV3jZCcb76rW","1: It looks to me that the those pilots were attempting to abort the landing when they suddenly realized that the landing gear was not deployed.

Well, Steve, all of these really big questions: How much are the black boxes going to shed light on answers? Yes, Rebecca. Everything will get answered by the black boxes. The video doesn't tell us anything; it just raises more questions. They'll want to read out the black boxes fairly quickly here to make sure there's nothing systemic to the 787. But at this point, nothing points to the 787 as being the problem. These two other incidents this weekend: Steve, what can you tell us about those? There's no superstition among pilots that mishaps tend to occur in threes. There was an airplane with a known landing gear problem for a long time; we saw that fire there, which was confined to the engine, so people on board weren't in any significant danger. The other incident was handled a little bit better but they just dribbled off into the grass.","comments":["0: Boeing is in serious trouble again , a Dutch airplane KLM had engine blowing up just like juju airplane . https://youtu.be/IRlW2BxoXXA?si=Fha8kV3jZCcb76rW","1: It looks to me that the those pilots were attempting to abort the landing when they suddenly realized that the landing gear was not deployed.

And how common is it for a bird strike to happen and how much damage does it actually cause?","1: This crash has really shaken me up after hearing about it here in the States. My heart and prayers go out to everyone who lost a loved one on that plane. Im just wondering if it would of helped any of the plane would have made an attempt to land on water instead of hitting the embankment? I am also wondering how often to pilots and crew on these airplanes get updated on emergency procedures? To me it feels like the pilot panicked when it had a bird strike and the landing gear wasn't working properly. I pray that these and other Korean airlines become safe again so there are no more disasterous incidents as this one.","2: This hits so close to home. Truly tragic. Sending my love to everyone involved and SK","3: Wonder what the North Koreans are saying about this","4: Please look at the end of the runway  after the antenna   Then note 100 feet is another 15 foot concrete wall  to surround the runway  along with fences then a 20 foot drop to a roadway then another earth mound 20 feet high.   How many of these softer berms do you think this plane could pass while traveling at 160 MPH?   The plane skidded on the the runway after missing the first  4500 feet of the 9000 total  if it kept going a factory was only another 1200 feet away","5: Pilots can’t dump fuel in a 737, you have to use it up by flying","6: A really fantastic commentary.  Thank you","7: I have LIKED and Subscribed! Rare for me to do.","8: Very thoughtful critic...makes a whole lot of sense.. some of the angles may be borderline defamatory.. but who cares when the situation at hand demands a tough call. Please keep at it until as far as you can go on this topic. Cheers Rick from Sydney, Australia","9: Don’t blame the birds or the pilots. Blame the idiots behind the idea of building that wall. It should have not been there, period. Had that wall wasn’t, the plane would have just skidded off till it comes to a halt instead of hitting that stupid wall and exploded. And no lives lost.","10: With the new update that police in the area has raided Jeju airlines and is not letting the CEO of the airline leave the country, with that and the other lesser weird things, i am getting a feeling that in the coming months ,maybe even March, a huge insider report will be uncovered or released that would reveal corruption or something funky like that was going on in  all of South Korean airline industry. Studiez have been done and have shown those who were seated at the very back of the plane had the best odds of survival during a plane crash","11: Watching the landing was peak devastation.  So hard to watch.  My deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers to the victims loved ones.  Your explanation of the concrete wall makes sense of why the chain of events happened the way it did. 😢 So sad...","12: The Boeing 737-800 does not have any means to jettison fuel. They touched down on the belly only 3 minutes after declaring mayday due to the birdstrike with only the right hand engine operating. The reasons for this decision have to be found out. I doubt hat they noticed the berm carrying the ILS antenna array in time, as there ist no noticable trace of evasive action. The reason for the late touchdown was floating due to the ground effect. Visit the blancolirio channel for details from someone who ist an actual pilot.","13: You can’t dump fuel on a 737-800","14: Jeju air korea 2024 12 29 nam1  HYBE LE SSERAFIM ILLIT new jeans 😢🎗️kpop group","15: I was on a belly landing before... they sprayed foam (?) on the runway, but we did not know what was happening until it happened, the landing gear did not work... ambulances and firebrigades were everywhere... no one got hurt, though... the pilot and the crew kept quiet until we touched ground... perhaps they had done this before...just glad it wasn't my time to meet Jesus then...","16: Boeing =  💩\nSouth Korea government = 🤡","17: I dont know, there must have been multiple failures with the plane itself. I understand pilots are under a lot of stress, but pilots \"forgetting\" to drop the landing gear? I doubt that was overseen by the pilots. Boeing has been experiencing a lot of mechanical issues due to negligence. The wall at the end of the runway is a poor design choice. A lot of planes might overshoot a runway in an emergency.","18: I think that the pilots did the best they knew..Lord please comfort the families connected with this accident, and remind us that, life is uncertain but we can choose our destiny","19: did not crash... hit the concrete wall","20: This is such a tragic loss, praying for peace for the families.","21: Weary pilots on overnight flight came in too hot, missed timing for landing gear, timing for flap deployment, severely overshot touchdown at beginning of runway. #1 priority once they knew they would be able to  reach the runway was to bleed off speed, they could have the ability - they touched down mid - runway, so it was possible. They had tailwind that increased relative ground speed. Should have landed with headwind - would have had a X2 factor in airspeed reduction. Final take: Failed to take steps to bleed off speed and failed to use all of runway on a marginal distance runway.","22: I think this guy might have something interesting to tall me, but it was so deeply buried in blah, blah, blah that I gave up on listening to him.","23: Why do so many channels speculate about it instead of waiting for the release of the FDR and CVR data like a sensible person would? Oh yeah- Clickbait. Not impressed, guys. Bye.","24: is it SOP go around when bird strike happend during landing?","25: Bro. Dirt or concrete wouldn’t matter. And it’s always better for a plane to land early to stop earlier. You keep saying things like “plow through”… Jesus Christ… take a physics class.","26: Human errors no excuses at all","27: Finally this channel posting some facts and not Hybe lies 😂","28: Just sad all around.","29: The wall was not causing the accident, but it was the determining factor for the loss of life, uncontrolled slides have been survived in many previos accidents as you demonstrate very well.","30: The landing gear that did not engage correctly. This happen to my flight when landing in Atlanta Georgia over 20 years ago. The Captain announced that the right landing gear had not engaged. We circled the airport for over an hour as he dumped fuel before attempting to land. While landing he hit the tarmack hard with a big thump to get the wheel down and then brought the plane completely down to land. By the Captain's incredible skills and the grace of God we landed safely. My thoughts and prayers go to the passengers, their family and the crew.","31: Thanks to the wall otherwise everyone would be perish..","32: btw, the mound of dirt/concrete cannot defend itself in court lol","33: but on 911 an airplane DID cut through steel like butta.....(yeah the the speed of the airplane - i know....)","34: Sean? Ive heard on the vine_and IDK if I understood correctly_that the engine of the right wing,was the one controlling the air pressure of the cockpit,making it destabilize and maybe dabgerous funes entered the cockpit(???) and when that happens they have to land the plane immediatly...\nI also heard that upon purchasing the airplane,JejuAir,didnt bought it with the mechanism that allows to dump the fuel/jettison\nAlso Ive heard,that both that airplane and the pilots/copilots were over worked,being the 1st not mechanically updated(apparently after idk how many air miles they have to update the fusselage and check the engines,etc kinda like a car that need regular checks and oil changes,etc)","35: Ayrton Senna got killed because he hit a wall at 300kmph.\nLet us get rid of every wall in every F1 circuit...","36: There is not a single video that is not full of booollsheeet.","37: Landing that fast with absolutely nothing to hold the plane back, no flaps, they were bound to hit an obstacle at some point, unfortunately. Whether the berm or the next built object in the following kilometer or so","38: Even if da plane landed at da beginning of the runway it would still hit da wall because of da speed the plane was doing perhaps 150Km when it left the end of the runway . The plane did not crash by itself but the wall was the reason for 179 people to perish","39: It's not the fault of the pilots. Those people onboard died because of the wall at the airport. What are da global standards when it comes to air port construction? What are the standards and who sets and checks da standards globally to determine if they meet the  requirements ?","40: Look closer the crapy logo of Je Ju Air... suspicion has raised by Korean video analyst.","41: RIP ro all those who passed. May this incident provide a good learning experience and safety and crisis management to benefit future generations.","42: 33:28 i like your background guesses. Like a detective. It can happen, I agree","43: 9:30 Honestly, I don't think that pilots even thought about a wall at the end of the track. They probably assumed that it would be safe, only to get an \"ugly surprise\" at the end of it. I don't think there was time to anylise anything, sadly..","44: I stopped listening right after \"the plane didn't dump fuel\", uh huh???","45: Excuse me  but do you know the 737???  Well 737 does not capable to dump fuel ok and many other item that you are stating","46: It reminds me Seoul ship accident and Itewan tragedy. 😢 All could be prevented.","47: Great report with a lot of good details that it’s hard to find. Thank you for your hard work on it. At the end though, profit system always will cut for the benefits and  will end up destroying itself to the core.  Balance and profit can’t coexist. Sanding prayers for all the families. My deepest condolences 😢","48: Thank you for a very comprehensive analyses of the tragedy that should have not happened with Jeju flight last Saturday. Praying for the victims and their families.","49: Great take. Thanks for providing alternative points of view. I never considered the pilots' dumping fuel before an emergency crash landing.","50: I don’t know enough about aviation to be a Monday morning quarterback about this tragic accident but I know that it is heartbreaking and I extend my deepest condolences and prayers for all the families affected.","51: why? the wall","52: …if only the plane landing gear is in perfect condition , while the experience pilot had already successfully landed the plane on the runway way , he couldn’t stop the speeding plane frm crashing into the concrete wall….if only the landing gear is working properly…the pilot could easily stop the speeding planes.","53: ….bcuz the Boeing plane landing gear is not functioning….","54: Who was the genius that designed a concrete barrier on the runway overrun???","55: why are you so intent on blaming someone? it's an accident","56: Boeing 737-800 -no fuel dumbing mechanism.","57: For those who don't know, the government company that operates 14 airports including Muan Airport where this tragedy occured is KAC Korean Airports Corporation.","58: One theory is the tired panicked crew shut the wrong engine down after the bird strike, if the wrong engine was shut down, the crew need to glide the aircraft onto the runway but at a higher speed, the best way to glide is without any drag, so no flaps, no undercarriage which is the configuration that the aircraft is in. The APU would provide power for the flying controls which is why they are able to place it on the centre line of the runway.","59: As far as I am concerned, the pilots did managed to bring the airplane onto the runway but had never anticipated that they hit the concrete wall. Until after they analyzed the flight records, we can only guessed why the Captain made that decision to land. \nCondolences to the families who lost their loved ones.","60: This is so gut wrenching, that something like this would happen now where aviation is suposed to be so safe.😢","61: My neighbor across the street is an American Airlines pilot. He says that sort of wall with a dirt ramp up to it, it's fairly common in Asia. In the US and other places, there is no wall or even hump, but rather if a plane goes too far and runs into the guidance equipment, it just crashes right through them. They're designed to break.","62: 😥🙏My heart just breaks, what a terrible tragedy.","63: I agree with you Sean, the concrete wall was illed placed","64: it seames very VERY SUS that they havent found the TWO blackboxes ...atleast 1 located at the cockpit ...sus...very sus...","65: when these types of dissasters ocurr...it is good to retrace steps and figure out how and why did it happened so to learn and prevent future tragedies...","66: Thank you Sean, always, for keeping us abreast of very important issues!\n\nThis news breaks my heart. I believe the airline itself is low par and that is the biggest problem. Another problem is they have no care for lives. They just want the €$₩!","67: Why didn't they foam the runway? My condolences to the families and my prayers for them🙏🙏🙏🙏","68: Thank you Sean for reporting on this terrible incident. Can you provide an update on the Itaewon crowd crush? I heard recently that President Yoon had vetoed a special investigation into it?? ☮️","69: AI pilots incoming, if every single accident is just gonna be a massive finger pointing contest.  Definition of accident doesn't exist anymore someone alive will get crucified for this regardless if they were innocent or guilty.   Are rational humans actually contesting that a wall is the problem and that the airplane landing scraping along the runway flames a blazing is perfectly normal?   Dumb world.  Imagine they plowed through the wall or it wasn't there, but the fuselage still exploded and killed everyone, they just gonna blame the airplane manufacturer.  Meanwhile the stats on \"bird strikes\" are quite common.  How many flights daily make emergency landings or have issues with landings that are successful?  Anyways, it is a sad day for Korea and Thailand... it reminds me of Korea Airlines Lines incident in the 1980s.","70: All this. There were bad designs, bad policies, bad maintenance, bad decisions and the fact that there was concrete under that  mound of dirt. I have heard of other airports with mounds of \"soft\" dirt or sand at the end of the runway to help slow down a distressed plane that had to do a belly landing but I have never heard of one with a mound of dirt over concrete just to rise up a locator tower.","71: The pilot might shut down the wrong Engine , plenty of pilot you-tuber mention this. in regard to concrete wall yeah its major contributing factor, but the distance within international body standard... plenty of other airport like San Diego international airport have car park, busy highway and even warehouse an businesses just meters from the end of the runway (if this plane land in that airport the victim will be 179 + car driver + people who work in business) , not to mention even if that wall not there, there is a row of tree beyond that runway that will do the same thing,not to mention other belly landing incident have the plane flip over and disintegrated,  the plane simple land to fast and land to far away from the start of the runway.","72: Sending my prayers and condolences to South Korea and all the victim's families🙏🙏","73: Completely unacceptable. I hope the civil engineer(s) responsible enjoy(s) the full extent of South Korea's justice system.","74: President is so incompetent. Every year there is some tragedy that could have been avoided. The airlines these days are crap too. Boeing again.","75: All that surrounding water, was that an option?","76: Thank you, this was very well done, I enjoyed your summary. I am heartbroken for those victims and their families 💔","77: Bird strike has nothing to do with the landing gear extension","78: Definitely the pilots fault. He should have made his initial landing and not attempt the second time by landing from the opposite end of the runway. Why would you expect to land safely from the opposite end? Like why would you expect your shoe to fit comfortably  if you put on your shoes backwards? Obviously, the airport was not designed to land from the opposite end of the runway.  Are pilots trained to land at the opposite end of the runway? And why didn’t air traffic controllers who are in the towers advise him not too with no gear down and knowing about the concrete wall in place,? Which the plane is definitely going to hit landing midway the at high speeds. Pilot error.","79: Most commentators are stopping the initial video before the fire explosion. We have already seen it. You are creating (30:10) more trauma for the viewers and disrespecting the loss of life.","80: Korean Airlines is not the best in the world. Look it up. It is Qatar Airways. I am American and I would never just be so biased and say American or Delta is the best in the world. Just cause you are korean, you do not have to say or believe everything Koreans do are the best in the world.","81: So killer concrete wall was deceptively covered in dirt. And elevated! The pilot had no idea the ‘wall’ was reenforced and not frangible","82: So killer concrete wall was deceptively covered in dirt. And elevated! The pilot had no idea the ‘wall’ was reenforced and not frangible","83: Exactly at 34:04 the pilot knew the berm was there. He didn’t know it was a re enforced concrete mound.","84: When it comes to public safety or applying rules and regulations that reduce revenue or require more money, Koreans are not about that.","85: Greed the ILS signals were placed in concrete to save money to repair signals after a typhoon.","86: My Deepest Condolences and prayers for the family and friends from this tragic event, My heart goes out to all of them 🙏","87: Is this anything to do with the Boeing 737 MAX 8 design that caused fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia?","88: The landing seems to be very rush. Flaps are used way before the landing to slow down the plane. And if the hydaulics had a problem, each system (landing gear and flaps) can be used manually (flaps manually was new to me and good to know). Why the hurry? With the wind from a different side, in the middle of the runway. The worst factor at the end was the wall. What a sad situation and I am so sorry for the losses.","89: Thank you for not showing the tragic final moments of this tragedy. From South Africa I send my deepest sympathy to everyone affected. My impression is that many small factors led to what became a terrible and avoidable end to so many lives. How were the pilots to know that there was a solid concrete wall at that end? The narrator did provide a possible reason why the pilots might have landed so far down the runway which might give the families of the flying crew some comfort but certainly no comfort for the families of the passengers. One hopes that the recovered black boxes can shed some light on why the pilots chose to land so soon after the birdstrike without landing gear and flaps which meant that once they were down they could not veer off the runway or slow down.","90: The pilot landed that plane beautifully considering the mechanical issues. The cement block feels like the reason so many lives were lost. It’s truly heartbreaking.","91: without the concrete wall we wouldnt even be talking about this crash a week later. It would be just another wheels up landing with no injuries. To all future pilots attempting landings at this airport should be warned about the concrete. \nNo doubt the airport will repair the wall and put the airport back in operation.","92: This is so tragic! Sending prayers of comfort to all the families that's been impacted by this disaster.  My heart goes out to all of South Korea!  So sad!🪷","93: A SOLID CONCRETE wall at the end of the runway ! Welcome to Korea. This IDIOTS should go to jail for a very long time.","94: Such a heartbreaking situation! My thoughts are with the families affected. Airplane accidents rarely have a single cause; they typically result from a mix of factors. However, in this instance, the primary issue was the reinforced concrete bunker-like structure at the end of the runway, which violates international regulations. Under the conditions of that landing, the pilot had no chance to steer clear of any obstacles in the aircraft's trajectory.","95: During the govt hearing in the miracle landing in the Hudson River, Caotain Sully stated,\n\n\"All the training in the world doesn't help when everything that can go wrong, does go wrong at the same time. A pilot is left to make the best decision they can make when in an unimaginable emergency and when they know they could lose the lives of a plane full of souls left in their care.\" (paraphrase)\n\nThis was a terrible tragedy. Many condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this accident. May the truth of what caused this event be understood very soon.🙏","96: Some serious 9/11 implications with this story...","97: From the ferry ⛴️ incident 304 lives to the halloween crowd 159 lives, now this... something is wrong in ur gov system. Lack of procedures, protocols, n REGULATIONS. ya always cut corners to \"save\" money... the results will always be tragic.","98: There was also one belly landing in Canada the same day because of what seemed to be a landing gear problem. Thank god, there was no wall at the end of the runway and the passengers were all rescued. I don't think it was the same kind of plane but maybe the landing gear is from the same manufacturer? It is strange to have so many planes with the same problem in the span of 2 or 3 days. I think they might have gotten away with a lot less casualties in Muan if that wall hadn't been there... My heart goes out to the families.","99: Even if the pilot made wrong decisions, he did land the plane perfectly.  Ultimately, it was that stupid hill that killed them."],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f0072b"},"video_id":"aRpMGQ-C22A","title":"Tragic Jeju Air Flight 2216 Crash: 179 Lives Lost in South Korea #planecrash #tragedy #airlinenews","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRpMGQ-C22A","text":"At least 179 killed in South Korea as a JUJ Air Boeing 737-800 operated by JUJ Air crashed during landing on Sunday, December 29th.

Today we dive into a heartbreaking event that has left the world in shock: A devastating plane crash at Seoul International Airport in South Korea claimed lives and raised critical questions. Join us as we uncover the details, explore the aftermath, and examine what led to this tragic incident. Stay tuned for our comprehensive look at this unfolding story on December 29th, 2024. A routine flight turned into a devastating tragedy: A Juu Air Boeing 737-800 carrying one (181) passengers and crew crashed during landing at Seoul International Airport in South Korea. The flight departed from Suwon, scheduled to arrive safely but something went terribly wrong during its final descent. Reports indicate that the aircraft skidded off the runway, glided with a concrete structure, and burst into flames tragically. 179 lives were lost, leaving only two survivors who are in critical condition. Investigators are working tirelessly to determine the cause of this catastrophe. Early theories suggest a potential bird strike or more issues with airport infrastructure, including the controversial concrete wall near the runway. Experts from the South Korean Aviation Authority, National Transportation Safety Board, and Boeing are collaborating to uncover the truth. The black box and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered and are being analyzed. This heartbreaking event has left families and communities in mourning.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f0072f"},"video_id":"NC_7TjXyHeg","title":"What happened in South Korea (Jeju Air Flight 2216 Crash) 🤍","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC_7TjXyHeg","text":"Hi guys. I first want to apologize for my appearance and my voice; I'm under the weather but still wanted to create this video so you're aware of what's happening in South Korea—the devastating news, and the reason why you won't be seeing any posts or new content from entertainment companies such as Big Hit, etc. This is a very sad news guys; it's not clickbait. It's real. So first off, my condolences and thoughts are with you, South Korea right now. I am sending all the positive vibes that I can to you, and also ask for my viewers to do the same if they don't want to, please just respect by not posting dumb things online; trying to play around with this is none of that should be happening. On December 29th, 2024, a South Korea plane crash happened. Jedu Airline flight 2216 had to land without its landing gear equipment setup. I will not be showing the footage; there's actual footage of the crash if you must watch it, you can Google it but personally, I do not feel the need to share that on my channel. However, the following screenshot does contain an image of the explosion so if it is too triggering for you or if you don't want to, please just skip ahead. There were 181 people on board and only two people survived.","comments":["0: My condolences, thoughts and prayers are with you, South Korea.\n\nIf you want to support me, join my patreon: Patreon.com/JoseOchoaTV","1: my condolences to all the families that have lost their loved ones may God give you the strength you need my prayers to all of you","2: ***** Thank You for That.

The two survivors were actually two staff members/crew members because of this, South Korea has declared a 7-day national mourning period until January 5th following the Jedu Airplane crash. This is completely understandable guys; what this means is like I said: no posts, no content, no announcements, no events as far as any entertainment companies are concerned. The majority of my viewers are here for BTS so Tak's birthday is actually today in Korea and nothing will be happening as far as that goes from the company's side. The official BTS account on Twitter posted the following information: \"Hello this is B-Ill Music, we pray for the souls of those who passed away in the plane crash and offer our deepest condolences to their families. We ask for your generous understanding regarding the fact that we will not be posting content related to V's birthday as scheduled today, December 30th. If you notice that there hasn't been anything posted from the company this is why it's completely understandable; like I said, should not be played with, should not have idiotic posts made. You guys, South Korea is in mourning right now for those who lost their lives today and for their family and friends who are mourning. The entire country is mourning. Thank you guys for listening, thank you for watching, and I'll catch you on the next one adios.","comments":["0: My condolences, thoughts and prayers are with you, South Korea.\n\nIf you want to support me, join my patreon: Patreon.com/JoseOchoaTV","1: my condolences to all the families that have lost their loved ones may God give you the strength you need my prayers to all of you","2: ***** Thank You for That.

Juju Air Flight 2216, a Boeing 787-30, was returning from Thailand when it tragically skidded off the runway at Muan International Airport. The devastating crash resulted in the loss of nearly all 181 people aboard, including 175 passengers and six crew members. Video footage widely circulated by South Korean media shows the harrowing moments of the crash as the jet touched down. Witnesses observed that the landing gear did not deploy, and the plane skidded down the runway before eventually colliding with a concrete wall. The impact sparked a massive explosion, with flames engulfing the aircraft. First responders arrived quickly but the chances of survival were minimal, according to a firefighting agency official. After the plane collided with the wall, passengers were thrown out of the aircraft; the official reported that the severity of the crash resulted in only two crew members pulling through. South Korean authorities confirmed that all but two of the crew members perished in the wreckage. Among the 173 South Korean passengers were a range of ages from young children to older adults, with many in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. The identities of the victims remain difficult to confirm due to much of the plane being completely destroyed. The cause of the crash remains under investigation; early reports suggest a possible bird strike could have caused a failure in the landing gear. Air traffic controllers had warned of such a strike just moments before the emergency landing attempt. This tragedy marks the worst air disaster in South Korea since 1997, when an Air KAL jet crashed in Guam, claiming over 200 lives. Juju Air CEO Kim E Bay has expressed his deepest apologies to the victim's families and accepted responsibility for the incident. While the investigation continues, the thoughts and prayers of many are with the victims and their families in the wake of this heartbreaking tragedy.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00734"},"video_id":"TtDp8pzUqCY","title":"Jeju Air Flight 2216 Crash: Tragic Details Unveiled |SOUTH KOREAN AIRPLANE CRASH 2024|","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDp8pzUqCY","text":"On December 29th, 2024, a very sad day occurred—a tragedy happened at Muan International Airport in South Korea.

The plane crashed during an emergency landing, which was shocking for everyone in South Korea and worldwide. Jedu Air is a well-known low-cost airline that had been using this plane since December 8th, 2024. The Boeing 737-800 is a common type of airplane. Jedu Air has 42 planes all Boeings. This terrible accident was a very sad day for Jedu Air and the families of those on board. The crash of Flight 2216 caused much sadness and disbelief in South Korea, a country known for its safe airplanes.

The media covered the event extensively, providing updates and information to the public. After the crash, rescuers worked quickly but faced difficulties due to fire and damage. 96 passengers and crew members died in the crash; it was a reminder of how precious life is. The official number of deaths showed how terrible the tragedy was. Even though many people were lost, there was some good news: two people—one passenger and one crew member—survived. They were found in the back part of the plane. Their survival provided some comfort to those affected by the crash. Trying to identify the victims was a difficult but necessary job, showing how many people were affected. The temporary morgue was set up at the airport. Families waited anxiously for news and hoped for the best while fearing the worst. The investigation into the cause of the accident revealed that there might have been problems with the plane before the crash. Investigators looked into everything, including records about the plane's maintenance and what the pilots did before the crash. The possibility of a bird strike and the earlier problem with the plane suggested multiple causes for the crash. Experts from different areas helped the aviation accident investigation committee, which investigates plane crashes in South Korea, to find out what happened. The black boxes that record what happens on the plane were found, helping investigators figure out what happened before the crash. Preliminary findings suggested a combination of mechanical failure and human error as the cause of the crash. The investigation into the crash of Jedu Airflight 2216 was a big and complicated job. Experts from different areas worked with the investigators to share information about the plane. The investigation, expected to take a long time, focused on many things. The crash of Jedu Airflight 2216 reminded people of other terrible plane crashes in South Korea, such as the Asan Airlines crash in 1993 and the Air China crash in 1997, which killed 68 and 129 people respectively. These past crashes have left a lasting impact on aviation safety.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00736"},"video_id":"TtDp8pzUqCY","title":"Jeju Air Flight 2216 Crash: Tragic Details Unveiled |SOUTH KOREAN AIRPLANE CRASH 2024|","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDp8pzUqCY","text":"The investigation into the crash is still ongoing, and families of the victims are waiting for answers.

They were made to withstand extreme temperatures, high-speed impact, and submerge underwater to help investigators retrieve crucial flight data like speed, altitude, and radio transmissions. Both damaged devices were sent to the US for further analysis after it was discovered that the crucial data was missing. All that is known about the crash is that just before the black boxes stopped recording, the pilots reported a bird strike to air traffic control, then declared an emergency and aborted a landing attempt, before smashing into the runway without the landing gear deployed. According to a former accident investigator for the Transport Ministry in South Korea, it is surprising that the data is missing from the black boxes, and it is possible that the aircraft lost all power, including backup—which is rare but could explain the missing data. Meanwhile, authorities have reassured the families of victims that other available data is being used to piece together what happened, and they confirm that the investigation would be transparent. This comes after some have spoken out against the Transport Ministry leading the investigation, calling for an independent party to take over. South Korea has ordered emergency safety inspections across all of its airline operations and on all Boeing 737-800s.","comments":["0: How much did Boeing pay them for this cover up?","1: Lies!","2: South Korea has a culture of saving face above all else.

Muan is part of the region firmly controlled by the opposition party, and this party has been proudly saying that the airport is their gift to their constituency.

So sounds like JeJu maintenance wasn't servicing the black boxes... somebody's going to be in a lot of trouble over this! It has already been suspected the plane lost electrical power when it flew thru the flock of birds because the plane's transponder had stopped transmitting right at that point in their landing approach which was not normal as it typically should continue transmitting until the plane is shut down at the passenger terminal gate. So this just confirms that things in the plane were much more dire than anybody thought, imho.","74: That’s convenient 🤷🏻‍♂️ cover up again then 🤦🏻‍♂️ Shock!!","75: What kind of bird can damage black box?","76: Korean government handed them over to NTSB/Boeing team.

Emergency workers managed to rescue two cabin crew members who were in rear jump seats at the tail end of the aircraft. 5. The investigation aims to understand why the slab was placed and whether similar issues exist at other airports.

Smell cover up and pilot error.don t need to wait for the damage control review common sense, will  shed the light.","3: Speculation: Remember the video of the aircraft in the air where a puff of white smoke comes out of one of the engines?  This was supposedly a bird strike.  However speculation is that the bird strike was prior, and what you saw was a puff of halon.  If the prior bird strike presented data to a pilot that indicated an engine fire as a result of the strike, the pilot would then pop a halon bottle to extinguish the fire.  Popping the halon bottle would shut down all electrical and hydraulic functions of the engine.  If a crew member in confusion and panic, popped the halon bottle to the other engine mistakenly, this would result in the aircraft loosing all electrical and hydraulic operations from that engine....with the result that both engines were powered down, all electrical and all hydraulic functions were lost.  This would interrupt electrical power to the black boxes.  Indeed, only some essential functions for the cockpit dashboard instruments would be the only thing operating on the aircraft, the instrumentation being powered by a battery.  This explains why the crew didn't manually deploy the landing gear.  If they did, the aircraft would have landed on the wheels and with no hydraulic power...no brakes and the aircraft would not have slowed down rolling on wheels.   Landing wheels up meant friction of the aircraft on the runway would have slowed it down, but unfortunately the high speed of the aircraft and the ground effects bubble of air under the wings kept the aircraft sliding down the runway, delaying slowing down.  This halon bottle hypothesis explains what we see...but where the halon bottles popped, blown out?  No black boxes means a lot of evidence about what really happened is lacking.","4: This video did not give a credible explanation for why the data recorder data is so mysteriously \"missing\" from devices so well designed to give such data. I absolutely do not believe that the devices all lost outside electrical power and that was sufficient to prevent them from recording.","5: Just coz you've got posh English accent don't mean you're intelligent mate","6: That must have been some bird that collided with that plane... a Pterosaurs or one of Daenerys dragons??","7: This aircraft was perfectly lined up with the runway, they must have had electrical and hydraulics, or this would have been impossible, engine was running, as the reverser was open (no it can't drag open), something doesn't add up, it's one thing to lose the FDR and CVR, but we also lost transponder at the same time.","8: I think it's wonderful how so many of us can blame after the fact and blame without any technical expertise.

There were columns underneath the slab","13: The pilots were apparently unaware that murderous, train-stopping concrete was in their path. They could have steered just a little off the runway, either direction to miss the barrier.","14: this story has been milked now there is nothing new to this other than the blackboxes not working.","15: Hitting the concrete wall inside a big mound of dirt was what killed everyone.

Events on the plane in the minutes before were the reason for the crash. Going on about \"The Wall!\" is an exercise in distraction and deflection. With respect to the wall, Jeju Air Flight 2216 was proverbially and literally in the wrong place at the wrong time. \r\n\r\nMuan Airport over 17 years has hosted more than 100,000 take offs and landings with no problems at all with the wall.\r\n\r\nNote: The concrete retaining wall that Ayrton Senna hit at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola at 14.17 CET 1/5/1994 at a speed of 233 kmh was not the cause of his death. His loss of control of the Williams FW16 in the seconds just before the impact was the reason for the crash.

The black box situation doesn’t make sense. Also, they should have been able to lower the landing gear one way or another.

It sounds like a series of mistakes or bad judgment from the pilots.","21: time for this bloke to stop doing interviews","22: This expert would benefit from staying on one topic, maybe show a relevant graphic supporting the topic being explained. There is decent explanation of the black boxes stopping recording if neither of the two redundant power buses are being powered, due to the design of year 2009 and earlier models. I have a bit of a tendency to ramble myself, it is good to mitigate it with a clear plan and graphics, or have someone interject questions when a subject is moved away from without being communicated effectively. This expert needs a good interviewer or other circumstances to make him effective, just asking him to ramble alone doesn’t generate clear messaging.","23: So much waffling saying nothing new","24: It has a main battery power..separate.

Since these are migrating birds, moving them is virtually impossible, so the airport should not be located there. It was a smaller local airport and only opened to international flights in December. There needs to be accounting for the decision to expand the airport in an area of known bird migration. Officials and airport administration need to be held accountable for that decision.

Most legit airlines have battery backup on the 737!","47: They should ask one of the passengers to start recording on his smartphone !\nMore reliable than a black box, lol\nThis makes no sense...","48: WTF ? Batteries only work in iPones, EVs and electric scooters, but not in planes ?\nNonsense, especially when the engine is still working !","49: Very convenient...","50: I don't believe the black box is part of that from the power source.

With the plane, of course.","55: This guy is on the take.","56: Oh, good. An expert. Everything he says will be sincere, informed, and intelligent.","57: This is just too convenient.  Not sure if I believe they lost the data, especially with the lies that have come from this government (US) over the last few years.","58: There's a system called RIPS (Recorder Independent Power Supply) that is basically a stand alone, dedicated battery pack for the CVR that will power the CVR and the cockpit microphones for 10 minutes after loss of all electrical power.  The FAA mandated RIPS I believe in 2013 for all newly built aircraft which are required to have a CVR and then several years later made a retrofit for older AC required. I'll have to look up the exact dates. Apparently Korea has no such regulation.","59: The \"turbo-fan blades are carbon fibre\" ?? This is an NG, not a Max.","60: Well most of it was not concrete. It was dirt. And the same installation excist other places around the world. But it is hard to keep track","61: Extend all runways to 5 km length?","62: This expert is complete BS……no hell in chance a CVR/FDR will fail in this case","63: The speaker is wrong. The ILS Localizer Antenna installation is compliant with the current ICAO guidelines, because it is outside the safety area. It was designed and built by the US military when the airport was a US airbase, during the 1950's.","64: Hmmm , it was odd in first place now it’s really odd","65: Coverup boeing","66: CVR & Data Recorder stopped 4 minutes leading to crash? What a fail by Boeing, NTSB and Korean Authorities. I assume ATC also stopped recording communication with this plane accordingly!!!!!!!!","67: Glider pilot here...  I see no evidence of an EXPERT interviewee. All I see is a befuddled and ignorant fool making broad and sweeping statements that bear little resemblance to the facts of the incident. Then, he excuses the two most critical facts that we know for certain: the plane came in WAY too fast and put down WAY too late on the runway. The speed might have been difficult for the pilots to decrease, but if that were the case, then there was even more incentive to ground the belly ASAP on the runway and dissipate energy.\n\nRemember, gliders are always in that situation. They can't go-around. Their pilots need to assertively place the craft on the runway at the earliest opportunity. They also have no powerful wheel brakes or reverse-thrusters.\n\nThere was no mention of possible pilot errors, such as the realistic likelihood of the pilots having shut off a good engine in error and then panicked, because their remaining bird-struck engine struggled on climb-out.","68: Where are the passenger's cell phones, and why isn't anybody talking about them? Every one of us today carries with us a cellular phone with a camera built in, at least some of the 180+ cell phones on that plane had to have survived and at LEAST 1 of them must have been taking video of the final moments of this doomed aircraft.... so why is nobody but ME apparently interested in the passenger's cell phones? Y'all might want to look into it! 😕","69: Reported that becouse of the winds and flooding they get there . They had to make the foundation more robust . The actual equipment was, as you described,  break a way . The equipment had to be raised because the runway is not level,  19 goes down hill .....","70: Makes you wonder what was said in the cockpit before the crash that needed to be redacted.","71: Ian Carroll may know,just saying.","72: South Korea has previously opened the black boxes of fighter jets purchased from the United States, despite being banned from doing so.\nAnd they couldn't get it back the way it was.","73: Weird, got 2 question in mind:\n1) I thought it still working communication with pilot with \"Mayday\" at 8:59 a.m / 9.01 a.m tower granted landing / 9:03 a.m. crash on structure. From news i see there are power and communication done. Why 4 minutes missing from black box?\n2) Aren't black box built behind the plane tail. There are also got 2 survivor behind the tail. Black box should be in good condition without 4 minutes missing.","74: Why can’t they put a screen like cover over the front of the engines to prevent birds from being able to go into the blades ?","75: The battery contained within the Honeywell black box is to power a recovery beacon which last for 30 days following the incident. The black box is powered from two electrical sources from the aircraft. If the aircraft power is cut then Comms. Are also cut and would not be recorded in any event. A fifth generation black box is being developed which will have RIPS Remote Independent Power Supply.","76: Couldn't they install some kind of grill/mesh, to prevent  birds from being sucked into the engine??? Just asking, for a friend.","77: The real reason is that it was made in China or by Samsung .","78: How can you simulate something you have no information about? Simulators can't magi up something from nothing.","79: How much money to lie? \nArent black boxes seperatley powered? Would take a lot of effort too destroy that.","80: Cover up","81: Because the bird","82: Pigeons the original drones","83: when i was a child 30 something  years ago... the black boxes recorded even without power for minutes or hours... before flight starts and after....... now they just dont work if you unplug them?","84: Makes you wonder who was on that plane ?","85: Tragedy upon tragedy.😓"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00739"},"video_id":"Y9Gbxv6gzSY","title":"Jeju Air Fatal Crash. This Changes Everything.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Gbxv6gzSY","text":"In the tragic incident of Juu Air 226, several factors contributed to the accident. The Boeing 737 aircraft faced an electrical emergency which made it challenging for the pilots to operate certain systems effectively. Human factors from older technology also played a role in the handling and decision-making process during critical moments. If this had been an Airbus, the ease of flying might have provided some relief but would not have significantly altered the outcome due to the aircraft's design similarities. The main causes could be attributed to the quick response required under emergency conditions, which sometimes leads to overlooking important steps like extending flaps or landing gear properly.","comments":["0: What can change the wall?","1: Blackbox sent to the US??? well that explains why the info went missing???Even taxi cameras have backup batteries!!!!","2: 4 minutes of blank recordings... I smell Boeing coverup.","3: Obvious foul play involved","4: They were coming in to land - why didn't they just continue to land rather than do a go-around?","5: At one engine lost, why would they not immediately start the apu?","6: bullshit","7: Why not aim for the water, at least there’s no solid concrete barrier. Why try for the runway?","8: I thought that CVR and FDR electrical power had backups.  \nAfter the AA FLT. 191 crash in 1979 where the left engine broke away taking with it the power for the CVR.\nAll the accident investigators got was \"DAMN!\" and then power went dead on the CVR.\n\nMust have been a massive power failure.  Or a power surge which popped all the breakers that turn the black boxes off.","9: @Flying for Money: Thanks for the video. Does this new information rule out the possibility that the pilots shut down the wrong engine by accident after the bird strike?  It seems like you implied that, but I'm a little confused if that is still a possible explanation for the loss of thrust in engine 2, or if the timeline from bird strike to recording failure rules that out?","10: Super-helpful, thanks!","11: Suicide by pilot ?","12: There’s something really vague about this.\n\nWhen was the video of the engine flame-out taken. Was it prior to the go-around or after that?\n\nIt can’t be before. At that time, the aircraft should’ve been fully configured for landing. Flaps extended and gear down. A stabilised approach criteria would be the aircraft fully conf at 1000ft, and I can see the go-around was initiated just below that altitude.\n\nIf the video was taken before, then the question would be: “Why didn’t just continue the approach and land?”","13: They should build in something like a single use battery for lowering landing gear.","14: This man spends too much time repeating the same thing about Boeing 1950s technology....when this is a new generation 737 built in the 2000's.\n\nPeople want to know about these pilots.... Captain Sully was a seasoned professional....what was the background of this captain????","15: What a great, concise explanation without any added drama. Even I can understand it!","16: I was always under the impression that the black box was practically indestructible & reliable almost always. The only time I hear of black box data not able to be recovered is when a plane falls into the ocean. This is the first time I’ve heard of an incident like this. I’m not an expert or anything but I’m just surprised this is the first I’ve heard of this in my 38 years of searching plane crashes with a morbid curiosity and obsession.","17: With well known bird strike issue the APU could have been run up beforehand to circumvent delays and inability to operate in time. Bad risk assessment and operating procedures; always plan for the worst case scenario. I would mandate APU should be running. I believe the Pilots most likely switched off wrong engine acting in haste and had not even contemplated the scenario; logically should have continued to land rather than over complicate and overload their capabilities. Hopefully even without black box data useful lessons will nonetheless be implemented; not least all backups fully operational and frangible obstacles.","18: So the redundancy system is basically unreliable.  And no independent battery for Blackbox?","19: Was the pilot worried of too much drag with uncertain thrust?","20: The flight deck on a 737-800 built in 2009 has been significantly upgraded from the 727 flight deck. Wow","21: Glad to see this video. People seemed quick to blame these pilots, but as a layperson it looked like they encountered serious problems and did their best to get the plane back on the ground ASAP. If it wasn't for that hill at the end of the runway I think everyone would have survived. I'm sure if the pilots knew there was a hill at the end of the runway that was going to kill nearly everyone, they would have used their rudder to skid the plane off the runway to miss that hill.","22: Go around for what ? - just land , do not loose time .","23: Hold on ! Bird strike in video was in the right engine yet the exhaust plume on landing was showing that engine was running the left engine was inert !!","24: Your videos and presentations in this accident are commendable.  Thanks for your professional perspective,","25: Its definitely not Boeings fault","26: Very comprehensible description.\nWell done!","27: No pilot error as I've been saying, I've watched thousands of airplane crash videos electrical failure was my guess based on what I've observed.","28: Here’s another question. Thrust reversers, don’t these need a signal from the landing gear as in landing to be activated as a safety factor? If the plane had no electric power, how could the reversers be operated?","29: So well spoken and easy to understand your thoughts on this sad crash. 😢","30: Thrust reverse should not engage with the gear up. The cowl most likely opened when the eng contacted the ground.","31: What about the RAT","32: Strange comment of this guy","33: Wartaal","34: Why didn’t the recorders continue operating off the main battery? Do all Boeing and Airbus planes lose their recorders when both engines fail? That seems really dumb.","35: Was it pilot suicide...???","36: Once again, most likely crew incompetence.","37: a very meticulous job for the Failure Analysis team","38: Sober and sensible analysis.","39: Seems to me the engine sucked in a drone, not a bird.","40: Is it possible they shut down the wrong engine like the Kegworth air disaster, looks like they were just running on the bird strike engine.","41: You'd think commercial airplane manufacturers would be required to provide battery back-ups for the recorders and essential flight controls.  \n\nBut oh yeah, Boeing is an \"iconic American company\", which usually translates to 'they've spent a ton of money buying votes on Capitol Hill so most decisions are made to enrich their shareholders rather than ensure the quality/safety of their product'.","42: Cover ups! Who touched the data who destroyed the data","43: A lot of water - would a water landing have been a better option?","44: 737 has 60 year old using interface. Is it too perfect to change, or to save a few bucks? A good design should help pilots not making errors, instead Boeing always blame pilot training. 737 should be grounded, even the black boxes are not working properly, it's ridiculous, on par with forgetting bolts on a door.","45: I thought the undercarriage could fall open without power?","46: Why are we talking about the airbus? I finally turned it off. Irrelevant","47: My apologies for being sarcastic on this tragic situation.\n\nAll I understand is that the plane itself got panicked at the bird strike and forgot to record anything.","48: The can be extended WITHOUT electrical power. I am retired 737 pilot and an instructor. The FDR and the CVR are powered from Transfer Bus 1.","49: Would this happen to an AIRBUS?","50: 4 minutes prior to disaster….how is this possible without tampering it? I feel like this can be deliberately done in order to hide something…","51: Looks like the pilots did a great job handling all the parameters","52: The landing was botched any way you slice it. The landing gear drops even without power or hydraulics by pulling a lever inside the cabin. Furthermore for whatever reason the pilots decided to use only half of the runway to do an emergency landing—make it make sense. This is 100000% on the pilots. Quit blaming the birds. Quit blaming the locator at the end of the runway.","53: @murexhyena maybe this vidéo update will help you in your next video","54: Whoever allowed the wall to be constructed needs prison time","55: Earned a sub , awesome breakdown.  - Surry Virginia","56: Would dropping the gear have raised the aircraft enough to partially clear that murderous, train-stopping wall, so that severe damage would have been avoided at the cockpit/cabin level, allowing some to survive?","57: I no longer have faith in the honesty of the Biden NTSB to provide the truth.","58: Absolutely none of this makes sense!","59: The question is,runway,wall,as ex 737 pilot?Many questions, feel sorry to all","60: Seems they didn’t have time nor altitude to extend flaps and lower gear for it to have any effect","61: Hard to believe no battery backup for data/voice recorders. Seems there was little effect from the single reversed engine else the plane wouldn't go straight. \nHorrible with that concrete barrier at the end of the runway.","62: I pray for answers for these families, although nothing will change the outcome.  Praying for these families.","63: What I don’t understand is why the landing gear was not down. As far as I know these are not Electrical operated but mechanical!!!","64: As always the media is still color blind...\nThe recorders are Orange, hear me, they are Orange and Not Black..\nI guess black sounds more gory...","65: Im suprised they cant just wifi all data back to tower .  If i can download and watch netflix on a plane how come these crafts cant transmit this crucial data?","66: Why is all these so called experts focused on everything except the concrete barrier they crashed in to that concrete barrier that disintegrated the plane!  What was the barrier doing there at the end of the runway?!?  Regardless what precipitated the failure of the normal approach to landing, if the concrete barrier wasn’t there, the plane would most likely still be intact and saved lives.\nUltimately, the concrete barrier killed them, dummies including this guy who’s babbling here.","67: Stopped recording four minutes before disaster, \nSound fishey, \nMore like Pilot suicide.","68: Rumours spread fast, they covered it up, black box will not perform like this,","69: Thank you for the detailed explanation of the accident.","70: Is it strange that the exploded plane wreckages found beyond the wall?","71: Surely bird strikes cannot do this much damage? If so, then their would never be any more flights??","72: I could see that the first time I saw the video. It looked to me as though the no1 eng wasn’t running. Before the no 2 engine had that surge. It was a duel engine failure by the looks of it. Or at least one being shut down and ingested a bird in the other.","73: CVR and FDR are on the battery bus. You only lose that bus if it's fucked or.....you pull the breakers.","74: You reckon it would be possible to delete the CVR, FDR data manually? Maybe the authorities are trying to cover something up? This whole situation stinks on every level.","75: 737 the widowmaker","76: That's a very good analysis, enjoyed the video","77: Great report Bud.\nAs a non flyer , thats a lot of stuff coming at ya in a short time. The human capacity kicks in, such a shame the ppl who put that runway obstruction at the end of the runway were not on that plane.\nIm a builder .\n lts so easy to excavate a footing and use the earth as form work ,than to form up and strip above ground. Unless the area is rock  and excavation is a big job.\nI gotta assume that was the case and thats what happens when accounts call the shots.","78: Is it an under wing engine? Would.the simple loss of power to the engine, for whatever reason cause the plane to descend just coz its not getting extra lift?","79: If the pilots experienced a total electrical failure, would there be a high possibility that they might have lost the flight instruments and panels? If the panels were out, would there be a way to tell if the flaps and gears are working correctly?","80: They should not have sent it to US. BOEING will falsify the data.","81: I've asked so many times, why the go-around when you are already coming into land and have lost the ability to fly???","82: I smelled like korean government want something covered up from this","83: My fear is that they're going to focus on \"that one mistake\" that the pilots made in a tense emergency situation instead of that concrete barrier that stood on the runway centerline for *years* and should not have been there!","84: Still don't understand why pilot chose not to land on initial approach, immediately after calling May Day, as plane was configured for landing. Isn't this Protocol?","85: The FDR and CVR should be getting power from battery even if all engines fail. This doesn't add up. It's weird the most critical last 4 mins are gone. I don't buy it.","86: These pilots got that plane on the runway. Does not matter about all the technical cram..\nThe biggest error was building that stupid concrete wall at the end of the runway. \nIf that concrete wall had not been there then probably most if not all passengers and crew probably would have lived..\n\nThose responsible for the concrete wall should be held responsible.. That wall was simply wrong","87: What if they ditched?","88: This is just a major cover-up by the Korean's government with Boeing group.","89: Why on earth would you put a hard massive berm at the end of the runway 😮?","90: THEY WILL STILL HAVE THE PILOT AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER RECORDING, RIGHT?.","91: Looks like there is a significant difference between Boeing and Airbus:\n1. Airbus would have had the RAT to gain minimal hyd. & electr power (wouldn't that also supply power to the flight data recorder?)\n2. Airbus uses the same lever to extend much need flaps/ slats instead of alternate switches which in a high stress situation is likely to be forgotten...\nor am I completely wrong?","92: I guess a big net at the end of the runway would be impractical and probably no material would be able to stop a fast plane without breaking or ripping the plane apart.\nHowever, why the hell not just have a big chute that deploys from the aircraft tail using an charge or large coiled spring? (for situations where there's a bird strike and/or multi engines out causing overshoot) Or am I dreaming?","93: I was looking at the plane for damage to the nose and possibly the windscreen from the birdstrike but there is nothing so no problem with visibility or a bird in your face. However, at 15:17 on your video you can see into the cockpit as the plane passes and it appears there is an arm raised perhaps bracing for impact or pointing at the retaining wall. That aside, right from the very start this is not ops normal.","94: We dont knwo that they were birds. what do you base it on? the pilots could be wrong. could be an engine problem.","95: The pilot made consecutive fatal mistakes. The Korean gov trying to hide it as usual","96: Recorders connectors damaged? Like might happen when removed from the wreckage?","97: What \"This Changes Everything\" ? Watched all..but didn't hear anything to your video caption.. Knew about the interrupted flight / data recorder four minutes prior - days ago.","98: Calling it now: they shut down the wrong engine, realized their screw up, and glided it in. That explains why the reverses were out on the damaged engine and why the airplane landed clean","99: The deaths were caused by the massive obstruction at the end of the runway"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f0073a"},"video_id":"_Gv9MLr5iSs","title":"Black Boxes DECODED: What did they say? - JeJu 2216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gv9MLr5iSs","text":"The black boxes from G Air flight 226 have finally been processed and their contents has been released to the public. All modern airliners are required to carry two black boxes: one's a cockpit voice recorder, and the other's a flight data recorder. The cockpit voice recorder records what the pilots are saying as well as any other sounds in the cockpit, such as alarms or warnings. The flight data recorder records much more information about the airplane, such as engine states and control positions. The circumstances of this crash that killed 179 people have been so puzzling that everybody's been waiting for the contents of these black boxes to help shed some light on the incident. Today, South authorities announced that they processed the data from both of these recorders. They announced that both of these recorders stopped recording 4 minutes before the crash; this is coincidentally at the exact same time that the plane stopped transmitting ADS-B location data. It's important to note that the data wasn't corrupted; the data just never existed. Many systems in the 737 are powered by only one of the two AC or DC power buses, and they were still able to communicate with air traffic control, meaning there probably wasn't a complete electrical failure, but it does indicate that an electrical failure was a contributing factor. We'll talk a little bit more about the design of the 737 later in this video, and about that concrete berm. But first, we need to talk about another accident: Why did G Air flight 2216 turn out so badly? When this other accident, which looks so similar, turned out so differently, it was LOT Polish Airways flight 16, with 231 people on board, and no fatalities. To understand what made these two flights so different, we'll need to go into the details of the incident. Flight 16 started in New York, just after takeoff, after they retracted the landing gear, they got a warning saying that the hydraulic system had failed. After consulting with some experts, they determined that hydraulic failure would only affect their landing gear and they had a backup electrical system that would extend the gear when they got to their destination. However, when they got to Warsaw, they didn't have enough time to use this backup system; hence, they landed without extending the gear. This is why flight 16 was safe, while flight 2216 wasn't. The right engine of G Airflight 2216 was running and the sound of engines can be heard during the final sequence. Some have even speculated that they might have had enough power to go around and try again. But we have to understand a bit about how these high bypass engines work: like the CFM56 found in the Boeing 737, the central section of the engine compresses air ignites it with fuel and throws it out the back to produce power. Part of that power is harvested with a turbine which is used to turn a fan at the front of the engine.","comments":["0: Sorry,  I don't believe that the FDR or CVR both stopped recording after a bird strike. If the pilots accidentally shut down the wrong engine,  that would have been recorded,  plus the battery backup would have given enough power for far more than 5 minutes. Something is very, very suspicious here. A possible cover-up might be happening","1: I would like to know every background of every fight passenger, what they did for a living, who they worked for etc on board now.","2: It was intentional !!!! Pilot was suicidal and left signs behind for his family","3: The pilots last words were “who put a wall there?”","4: The video clearly showed the engine running and I heard the sound of the reverser working, pilots are taught, landing with one engine reversers don't get used, but they were, so did they just forget landing gets and flaps, the aircraft with all the warnings would have been screaming out landing gear, flaps, landing gear, flaps this is a weird one, everything was skipped, and me thinks Korean investigators knew why and deleted the data.","5: Please don't talk so fast.  It makes me anxious.","6: Looks like Boeing is at it again.","7: The reason there is not black box, because of the “uninterrupted autopilot “ which give governmental secret agents full control of the plane. Directly from the manufacturer “ that take full control of the plane despite of manual over right procedure.","8: They should have nets, like those huge carriers","9: BS","10: black boxes were turned off four minutes before no information don’t watch video","11: Boeing sucks","12: Talk faster please then i am sure i do not understand it","13: How can a Black Box stop recording ????","14: At last someone with a good perspective about the \"wall\" !","15: Because it was hacked, they switched it off remotely.

Why was it not active?","20: heres my theory, the pilot switched off the wrong engine... why, see on flight radar, the transponder just doesn't stop when there is power, and the same goes to this 737 , they switched off the wrong engine, the transponder and black box stopped...","21: Why do you need the Black Box when the camera of the filming video was showing when the airplane hit the concrete wall and killed them all?","22: Sounds like a cover-up","23: Oh flip me. Another Grassy Knoll.","24: South Korea has a culture of saving face above all else.  The Korean govt intentionally tampered with the black boxes to remove the last 4 minutes so that either the pilots, or the air traffic controllers, or the government stooge who chose to put that cement wall there could save face.  Maybe all 3.  Either the pilots said or did something embarrassing or dumb, or the air traffic controller did.  I'm betting the pilots shouted at the end 'why the F is there a cement wall here?  curse you govt stooge who put this here!'.  So they Koreans deleted that from the boxes...","25: I hope no more mystery accident afterwards","26: Stop Flying - Walk !!","27: I call bs","28: I think this is now officially a conspiracy","29: Holy crap can you please speak more slowly?","30: I'm an NTSB Air Safety Investigor.  You sir are clueless both of this incident and especially the hardware that comprises the 737. The only information that has been released IS the fact of the missing data from the CVR and the DFDR do to ALL  AC power lost to the AC essential busses. Take one guess why ALL AC power sources were lost! And THE ONLY REASON the flight crew could communicate with AC was because battery power was supplying to the aircraft's static inverter which powered VHF 1. And, the thrust reverser everyone claims was deployed on the #2 engine...was not. In fact the gap you see is the dislodged FAN COWL. Both thrust reversers were found stowed. Lastly Mr Aviation. Not only was there no AC source to provide alternate flap/slat operation...the trailing edge flaps alternate source is AC and the leading edge flat/slat standby hydraulics by the standby pump in the main wheelwell...but the aircraft also had NO \"A\"or \"B\" SYSTEM hydraulics.  The A system has an electrical hydraulic pump AND an engine driven hydraulic pump...by the #1 engine. The B system...the same...except the B system engine driven pump...by the #2 engine. ARE YOU GETTING THE PICTURE YET?!?\n\nAnd why did the crew not do the alternate landing gear extension?  If they alternatively extended the gear...they WOULD OF HAD BRAKES via the brake accumulators EXCEPT...\n\nTo alternately unlock and free fall the gear requires a first officer to get out of his seat, open the alternate gear extension access door on the cockpit floor...then firmly pull , individually...on the THREE alternate gear extension handles. No, the first officer CAN NOT DO THIS while still seated...and obviously they had NO TIME FOR THIS BECAUSE...BECAUSE...BECAUSE...\n\nNow, your video description claims the Investigors NOW KNOW THE REASON why all the things I've described to you happened. But why don't YOU TELL US Mr Aviation?!?\n\nI know because...I was immediately sent to the accident scene because I've been around the 737 since 1980 with PeoplExpress' 737-100s and know all variants of the 737...including the MAX ...AND... guess whose daughter was the First Officer on the Alaska Airlines 737 MAX that experienced the door/plug departing the premises on January 5th of last year!\n\nTo that end. QUIT TRYING TO SOUND LIKE SOMEONE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF AN ACCIDENT WITH FATALITIES...DAMN IT!","31: Made By BOEING, Blackbox stop recording due to bird strike","32: Sounds like Boeing needs to combine both the voice and flight data in one unit and duplicate it across two separate power grid for redundancy.","33: wtf, you didnt get into the data and facts, instead you add speculation?!","34: Electrical inversion AC/DC... Boeing😡","35: How about we lose the \"Black Box\" term.  It's either a \"flight data recorder\" and/or a \"cockpit voice recorder\".  Further, neither are \"black\".","36: Clickbait title: there was nothing to decode! TD","37: Was that really a bird? Or somekind of drone with EMP?","38: The attitude of the Korean culture is not to allow anything that may make them look irresponsible ,  to be seen, by human eyes.....I worked with a Korean nurse who was that way. Changed her name and lied about her past as a nurse as she went to dental school. Being a nurse was not respectable enough for her. She wanted to look better so she lied. I expect there was some erasing done in these boxes, before they got sent to the NTSB. Laser ? radiations ? who knows how they did it. Maybe they should use a Geiger counter on these boxes, to see if it beeps......Just a wild guess.

Both engines were out of action as this ties in with the flap and gear config. The backup hyd system was working, otherwise the thrust reverser on the no. 2 wouldn’t have deployed.","45: The old runway extends another 5-600m past the berm and can be seen clearly on Google maps. If the aircraft had hit the ILS array, built without the berm, even at 160kts, it is highly probable that it would have remained largely intact and many more lives saved. Look closely and you can see the remains of the old runway, which probably means that it is relatively flat past the berm.   https://maps.app.goo.gl/hprSSwM8i9wUJwDV8","46: Take a note from NHRA, they dont put solid walls at the end of the drag strip...","47: Liar.","48: The WALL killed the people.","49: Dual engine failure, APU wasn't started and no battery backup on the CVR/FDR's (they weren't required when the 737NG was built and the plane may not have been retrofitted with them.  Now, was the dual engine failure a true dual engine failure due to multiple bird strikes in each engine or did they cut off the wrong engine?  That's the question that needs to be answered.  The fact that both the flaps and the gear were not down means they couldn't get them down in the time between hitting the birds and getting to the runway.  No hydro pressure and no electrical system.","50: They JeJu flight did not touch down early on the runway ...it bellied past the aiming point.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Air_Flight_2216","51: Hey, the title of the video is very confusing, because it promises some kind of answer for this accident!","52: So do we know who the pilots were?","53: Full of heavy fuel..","54: Click bait.","55: 4 last and most important minutes of recording are missing. Entirely because of a bird strike!\nIn US they call it _\"independent investigation\"._ 👈🤣🤣🤣","56: Well that clears things up.\nMaybe we should make black boxes for the black boxes.","57: Piss poor performance promotes problems","58: I don't find it strange that the data recorder was off. I also do not find it strange that they are stating that the \"wall\" was not known about, considering they flew over it prior to returning to that exact runway...unless a pilots resume includes blindness for qualifications these days???","59: Are you in a hurry to get somewhere? Did you not have enough time to record - when you sad down to do so? WHY the speed-speak? This is not enjoyable - I'm not studying for school and this is not 'required viewing to do my report'... I checked out your video (first time viewer) out of general interest.  I'm not subscribing because this isn't enjoyable; to me, you're racing the pace.

Nothing to do with birds or electrical failure.","62: Obviously Boeing deleted the data because Boeing Airplanes are super dangerous.","63: Design sucks. Did Boeing use DEI hires for that?","64: Sabotage...This plane got totally destroyed hitting the wall, yet the jets used in the twin towers passed thru concrete and steel?

I think it was a missle not a bird i seen tons of planes hit by birds and they still land idk something is up","66: Click bait !!","67: The wall at the end of the runway did them in","68: Overall, it sounds like pilot error(s) led to the ultimate crash.","69: Boeing it is. Even the black box stopped working.","70: Said nothing about what was on the black boxes recovered.","71: The crucial 4 mins not recorded. ATC has no recordings either?\nWhat a fail by Boeing, NTSB and Korean Authorities","72: What do we know about the mental health of the pilot?","73: If the sk plane had the gear down maybe it could have survived the crash with the berm, as it could hold the main body higher. Going belly dragging  led the plane to crash head on.","74: 100%  Coverup  .. again","75: Im subscribed because the pilot is very good 👍 😊","76: it was pilot error. pilots rushed the landing.","77: surely in this age a black box can have a gopro or camera installed.","78: It is highly unlikely that the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) failed to record the last 4 minutes. The CVR has an independent power supply (battery powered) that is separate from the aircraft main power supplies. This battery powered supply must allow recording for up to 10 minutes after total power failure. Even if main power completely failed, which is also unlikely due to the APU, the CVR would still continue to operate. FAA document AC 20-186, 2.10.3 describes the requirements for CVR power supply. Those are the facts. Now for speculation. If the aircraft was on final when the bird strike occurred, then the pilots would have initiated a \"go-around\" procedure. This means landing gear up, establish climb, and flaps up. On final, they would have already executed most or all of their landing checklist, but when the bird strike occurred, and they had to go around, then stress in the cockpit was high. As they were approaching again, they were busy flying the plane with one bad engine. Due to stress, and having already gone thru the landing checklist before, they just forgot to put the gear and flaps down. No one wants to hear that the pilots just forgot !  Therefore, a cover-up. It's easy to say the recorders stopped working. But, the chances of having both recorders fail simultaneously is so remote that we can safely say that it is impossible.","79: No, the FDR and CVR black boxes have NOT been 'decoded', and the contents have NOT been 'released to the public'. It's dishonest to claim they have.","80: Calling them \"black boxes\" causes me to immediately stop watching. Using proper terminology is professional.","81: Thanks for posting. Of course, this prompts the question \"WHY did the recording stop?\"\nIt seems odd that something so important, especially if there is a crash, does not have double, or even triple redundant support. Do both the flight data recorder, as well as the much less sophisticated, less interconnected cockpit voice recorder LACK redundant power sources, and even a short lived, self supporting battery?\nLacking this, the only information one might obtain from on board might come from the two surviving flight attendants seated at the rear, providing they can recount anything of substance.","82: It was that damn berm that killed everyone. Also it is not strange that the black boxes ceased to record since this was a  Boeing 737 flying coffing made by Wall street.","83: But did they dump fuel? It's something I cannot either get...","84: The key difference in the JeJu Air and LOT incidents, is that the lot aircraft had both main engines running at could lower the flaps. They had time to prepare, the Jeju aircraft had 3 minutes.","85: The birds must be the pilots.","86: Wouldn't the tower have communications with them? Possibly asking them to engage the landing gear? To slow down? The communications with the tower are saved.","87: Clickbait","88: Out of date, behind the times, Boeing 737 kills again.","89: Lufthansa had a crash in Warsawa in the early 90’s hitting the wall at the end of runway 29, that you mentioned.","90: 1:15 767 and 737 slide on runway different. 767 is bigger but problem same no gravity gears","91: There’s something very fishy with this accident.\nWas there someone important in the flight? Like a politician or someone very influential that needed be silenced?🤔","92: Korean pilots… woah.","93: its important to note that even the Emast aresting system - seem to have been design with at least par of the landing gear deployed... So I'm not sure how much it would have slowed the jeju flight down.\n\nDegardless of what happened - Is was that huge chunk of concrete on the end that really cause the damage.","94: Cover up","95: ❤❤❤❤","96: Well, that's a misleading title.","97: *the truth is that the send the recorders to USA bec. the best laywers and insuranceexperts work there and they told them how to explain the last 5 minutes before the crash*","98: Boeing cover up","99: The only way I can think that the data recorders would stop recording was if the physical links to them were interrupted. So we are talking cable or connection damage, as they have internal battery back ups to continue recording on external power loss. \nIt is probable that the boxes were still recording, however they had no information to store. \nHow this has happened is a total mystery. \nIt seems at least one engine was affected by a compressor stall probably caused by a bird strike. The aircraft still had some propulsion, some control surface ability and some electrical power available as they continued to fly and communicate. However it would also seem that hydraulics were lost as well, but that also makes no sense as the normal flying controls were operational? (no flaps, no landing gear)\nIf the boxes stopped recording data immediately on the bird strike rather than after a period of time when things could have got worse, that kind of rules out an onboard fire or other worsening scenario? \nBut how did a bird strike incident cause immediate internal damage to the aircraft? \nMy thoughts are still with total panic and very poor abilities and CRM of the pilots after a fairly \"normal\" emergency, but that still doesn't explain the loss of data?"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f0073b"},"video_id":"BN27Em76j6c","title":"🚨 BREAKING NEWS!

There is some breaking news, and it is pretty shocking. I don't believe I've ever heard of this happening before.

Try to find a technical solution before, then you don't need to speculate in every direction. Or is it just clickbait? The electric system of the 737 NG series (before 2010, as it is in this case) just HAS NOT POWER backup via Standby Bus / Battery if electrical power from both engines is lost. They experienced a total power loss, either by ingesting birds in BOTH engines (a drop in N2 below a certain value will kick out the GEN immediately) or by inadvertent shut down of the good engine.

The FCOM is quite vague and only gives an overview of the systems. He's going to check technical documents. Most of these NGs were built before the requirement for the CVR and FDR to have longer recording capability and it's own backup power source. It will be interesting to see what comes out of this.

The crew continued the approach as planned.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #1:\nPassive warning: ATC did not issue clear commands to avoid the bird strike, leaving the decision entirely to the crew.\nGraph:\nNo significant changes in the yellow line (vertical rate); the aircraft continued its normal descent.\n08:58L - Bird Strike\nEvent:\nThe aircraft encountered a flock of birds, with multiple birds striking the right engine and damaging its fan blades. The engine remained operational but likely showed signs of instability (vibrations or power fluctuations).\nThe crew declared a Mayday and began assessing the damage.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #2:\nThe crew decided not to continue the landing on Runway 01, even though it might have been possible to land with a partially damaged engine.\nGraph:\nThe yellow line dips slightly, indicating the aircraft briefly leveled off or slowed its descent as the crew assessed the situation.\n08:59L - Go-Around with Both Engines\nEvent:\nThe crew initiated a go-around, increasing thrust on both engines. The damaged right engine was heavily loaded during this maneuver.\nThe additional load caused the right engine’s fan to fail completely, leading to:\nA compressor stall, visible as flames and sputtering in video evidence.\nGenerator failure, reducing electrical system capacity.\nA significant loss of thrust from the right engine.\nThe left engine became the primary thrust source.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #3:\nThe decision to go around placed excessive strain on the damaged right engine, causing it to fail completely.\nGraph:\nThe yellow line (vertical rate) rises steeply, showing the increased thrust from both engines during the initial go-around. It levels off near the top as the right engine loses power.\n09:00L - Left Engine Shutdown\nEvent:\nThe crew shut down the left engine, potentially due to smoke in the cabin or a misdiagnosis of the situation, assuming the right engine was still partially functional.\nThe shutdown resulted in:\nTotal electrical failure, as the left engine’s generator stopped. Critical systems, including hydraulics, were powered only by the battery.\nHydraulic system limitations, preventing the extension of flaps and landing gear unless manually deployed.\nThe aircraft remained partially controllable but without the ability to adjust flaps or landing gear hydraulically.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #4:\nThe left engine shutdown sealed the situation, as the aircraft was left without sufficient power for full system functionality.\nGraph:\nADS-B data transmission ceases at this point due to the loss of electrical power.\n09:01L - Preparing for Landing Without Gear or Flaps\nEvent:\nThe aircraft was approaching Runway 19 with no landing gear or flaps extended, as these systems had not been deployed manually.\nThe crew focused on maintaining control of the aircraft using limited hydraulic systems supported by the battery.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #5:\nThe failure to manually deploy the landing gear and flaps resulted in an uncontrolled landing attempt, making it nearly impossible to stop the aircraft safely.\n09:03L - Crash into the Embankment\nEvent:\nThe aircraft slid across Runway 19 without landing gear or flaps, relying on fuselage friction for deceleration.\nGround effect provided additional lift, making it difficult to reduce speed effectively.\nThe aircraft collided with a concrete-reinforced embankment, leading to catastrophic destruction.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #6:\nThe embankment’s reinforced concrete structure exacerbated the severity of the crash. A softer barrier might have mitigated the damage.\nGraph:\nNo data is available for this phase, but reports and video evidence confirm the sequence of events.\nSwiss Cheese Theory Holes\nATC Bird Warning Insufficient:\n\nThe bird activity warning did not result in clear instructions for the crew, such as a go-around or diversion to Runway 19.\nCrew Decision to Abandon Landing on Runway 01:\n\nThe crew opted for a go-around instead of continuing the landing, which might have been safer despite the engine damage.\nGo-Around Decision:\n\nThe go-around placed significant stress on the damaged right engine, causing it to fail completely.\nLeft Engine Shutdown:\n\nShutting down the left engine led to a total electrical failure and reliance on limited battery power for critical systems.\nFailure to Manually Deploy Gear and Flaps:\n\nThe crew did not deploy the landing gear and flaps manually, leading to an uncontrolled landing attempt.\nReinforced Concrete Embankment:\n\nThe embankment’s rigid structure increased the crash’s destructive impact, reducing survivability.\nKey Observations and Lessons\nThe bird strike was the first critical hole:\n\nATC’s passive approach and the lack of immediate action by the crew allowed the chain of events to begin.\nGo-around decision escalated the situation:\n\nWhile understandable, the go-around decision placed undue stress on the damaged right engine, triggering its complete failure.\nManual intervention could have mitigated the outcome:\n\nExtending the landing gear and flaps manually might have allowed for a more controlled landing, even with limited hydraulic power.\nConcrete embankment exacerbated the crash:\n\nA softer, energy-absorbing barrier could have reduced the severity of the crash.\nThis timeline demonstrates how each step of the event chain corresponds to a Swiss Cheese Theory \"hole,\" leading to the tragic outcome.","40: No atc tapes.

The black boxes will lose power if the left engine is lost! The APU restores power, but it was never started. This is a feature, so it is not a defect or malfunction.

Aren't these boxes supposed to emit regular \"pings\" days after a crash, to help localize the plane?","48: It is sad and disappointing, but not shocking. I was totally expecting this to be the case and I even mentioned it since day one in a couple of internet aviation forums.\nWe knew since day 1 that the plane stopped broadcasting the ADS-B data (i.e. the \"radar\" data shown by the airplane tracking sites) on the first approach at an altitude of 900 ft, more or less at the point where it started to go around. There are several things that can cause this, from a mistake with the pilot accidentally turning the transponder off when trying to input the emergency code (7700), to a failure of the transponder or ADS-B transmitter. But we knew that the plane hit birds (the pilot reported it and we saw the flames from the compressor stall in the video), we knew that they were in a lot of rush to land, and the non-extension of flaps could be an indication of hydraulic issues. In that context, a very good candidate as a cause of the interruption of broadcasting of ADS-B data was loss of the electrical systems. The electrical systems are fed by two engine-driven generators and an APU driven generator. The APU was most certainly off (it always is in flight, unless turned on due to ab abnormal situation) so the loss of the electrical systems would mean that both engine-driven generators likely failed, which in turn could be an indication of total or partial failure in both engines (which drive the generators). There is a battery-powered essential electrical bus, but that feeds very few things that are critical to keep the plane under control. For example, it powers the Captain's flight instruments, but not the first officer's. It powers only one communication radio, but not the other one. And it doesn't power the transponder, ADS-B transmitter and, you guessed it, the CVR and FDR.","49: If the south koreans would be stupid enough to try and cover something up here, is it safe to say, only they are stupid enough to make the mistake they are trying to cover up?

Both Black Boxes On JeJu Air Crash Plane  STOPPED RECORDING 4 Minutes Before Crash🚨","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN27Em76j6c","text":"Let's read it together. It says: \"South Korea flight recorders from the passenger jet that crashed in South Korea last month, killing more than 170 people, stopped working minutes before the plane belly-landed and exploded on the runway. Investigators in South Korea said Saturday today officials probing the country's deadliest aviation accident in almost three decades had hoped information from the so-called black boxes would shed light on \"JGU Air\" flight 2216 from Bangkok. The belly-land at Muan International Airport on December 29. But South Korea's transport ministry said Saturday that both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight recorder from the 737 had stopped working about 4 minutes before the crash, while still in the air. If you'll recall, all communications were lost with the tower at the same time. Really anything electrical so whatever caused that electrical fault may have caused this. I don't know. Some of you 737 operators out there let me know. I think this plane was built and sent out before the FAA battery backup requirement. But I still don't know why both would stop working. I mean, they didn't have a lot of time that's obvious because they did the 180, spun back around, came back in the wrong direction so they didn't have time to drop out land the gear; they didn't have time to start the APU apparently. So whatever was going on was pretty instant but now it appears we're not going to know because both the flight recorder and the data recorder stopped working. In a statement, the ministry said it was unclear why the devices stopped recording, adding that it will work to determine the cause. CBR and FDR data are important data for accident investigators, but accident investigations are conducted through investigation and analysis of various data so we plan to do our best to accurately identify the cause of the accident. The ministry said this is puzzling these boxes are built to withstand the worst scenarios; they've been underwater for months and they've been found pinging and active. They've been burnt up, they've been smashed beyond repair seemingly, and they're still able to extract the data. Why would the power to the black boxes be off? Why would the power to the plane be completely off? And yet we see the plane one engine running; you could hear the engine running as the plane belly-landed. So unfortunately, all this does is provide more mystery than answers and I don't have any answers for you right now.","comments":["0: You think North Korea is shady?

The crew continued the approach as planned.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #1:\nPassive warning: ATC did not issue clear commands to avoid the bird strike, leaving the decision entirely to the crew.\nGraph:\nNo significant changes in the yellow line (vertical rate); the aircraft continued its normal descent.\n08:58L - Bird Strike\nEvent:\nThe aircraft encountered a flock of birds, with multiple birds striking the right engine and damaging its fan blades. The engine remained operational but likely showed signs of instability (vibrations or power fluctuations).\nThe crew declared a Mayday and began assessing the damage.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #2:\nThe crew decided not to continue the landing on Runway 01, even though it might have been possible to land with a partially damaged engine.\nGraph:\nThe yellow line dips slightly, indicating the aircraft briefly leveled off or slowed its descent as the crew assessed the situation.\n08:59L - Go-Around with Both Engines\nEvent:\nThe crew initiated a go-around, increasing thrust on both engines. The damaged right engine was heavily loaded during this maneuver.\nThe additional load caused the right engine’s fan to fail completely, leading to:\nA compressor stall, visible as flames and sputtering in video evidence.\nGenerator failure, reducing electrical system capacity.\nA significant loss of thrust from the right engine.\nThe left engine became the primary thrust source.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #3:\nThe decision to go around placed excessive strain on the damaged right engine, causing it to fail completely.\nGraph:\nThe yellow line (vertical rate) rises steeply, showing the increased thrust from both engines during the initial go-around. It levels off near the top as the right engine loses power.\n09:00L - Left Engine Shutdown\nEvent:\nThe crew shut down the left engine, potentially due to smoke in the cabin or a misdiagnosis of the situation, assuming the right engine was still partially functional.\nThe shutdown resulted in:\nTotal electrical failure, as the left engine’s generator stopped. Critical systems, including hydraulics, were powered only by the battery.\nHydraulic system limitations, preventing the extension of flaps and landing gear unless manually deployed.\nThe aircraft remained partially controllable but without the ability to adjust flaps or landing gear hydraulically.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #4:\nThe left engine shutdown sealed the situation, as the aircraft was left without sufficient power for full system functionality.\nGraph:\nADS-B data transmission ceases at this point due to the loss of electrical power.\n09:01L - Preparing for Landing Without Gear or Flaps\nEvent:\nThe aircraft was approaching Runway 19 with no landing gear or flaps extended, as these systems had not been deployed manually.\nThe crew focused on maintaining control of the aircraft using limited hydraulic systems supported by the battery.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #5:\nThe failure to manually deploy the landing gear and flaps resulted in an uncontrolled landing attempt, making it nearly impossible to stop the aircraft safely.\n09:03L - Crash into the Embankment\nEvent:\nThe aircraft slid across Runway 19 without landing gear or flaps, relying on fuselage friction for deceleration.\nGround effect provided additional lift, making it difficult to reduce speed effectively.\nThe aircraft collided with a concrete-reinforced embankment, leading to catastrophic destruction.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #6:\nThe embankment’s reinforced concrete structure exacerbated the severity of the crash. A softer barrier might have mitigated the damage.\nGraph:\nNo data is available for this phase, but reports and video evidence confirm the sequence of events.\nSwiss Cheese Theory Holes\nATC Bird Warning Insufficient:\n\nThe bird activity warning did not result in clear instructions for the crew, such as a go-around or diversion to Runway 19.\nCrew Decision to Abandon Landing on Runway 01:\n\nThe crew opted for a go-around instead of continuing the landing, which might have been safer despite the engine damage.\nGo-Around Decision:\n\nThe go-around placed significant stress on the damaged right engine, causing it to fail completely.\nLeft Engine Shutdown:\n\nShutting down the left engine led to a total electrical failure and reliance on limited battery power for critical systems.\nFailure to Manually Deploy Gear and Flaps:\n\nThe crew did not deploy the landing gear and flaps manually, leading to an uncontrolled landing attempt.\nReinforced Concrete Embankment:\n\nThe embankment’s rigid structure increased the crash’s destructive impact, reducing survivability.\nKey Observations and Lessons\nThe bird strike was the first critical hole:\n\nATC’s passive approach and the lack of immediate action by the crew allowed the chain of events to begin.\nGo-around decision escalated the situation:\n\nWhile understandable, the go-around decision placed undue stress on the damaged right engine, triggering its complete failure.\nManual intervention could have mitigated the outcome:\n\nExtending the landing gear and flaps manually might have allowed for a more controlled landing, even with limited hydraulic power.\nConcrete embankment exacerbated the crash:\n\nA softer, energy-absorbing barrier could have reduced the severity of the crash.\nThis timeline demonstrates how each step of the event chain corresponds to a Swiss Cheese Theory \"hole,\" leading to the tragic outcome.","40: No atc tapes. No pilot names. Looks like korea cut the cvr to BEFORE anything happened.  Then they sent the data bix to ntsb to make a nice matching cut.  They clearly don't know how to neatly cut the data recorder to make their story look credible.","41: The black boxes do not have a battery for data collection and the black boxes are not on the hot battery list. The black boxes will lose power if the left engine is lost! The APU restores power, but it was never started. This is a feature, so it is not a defect or malfunction. I don't know if this will cause changes in the future or not, but it's probably an important thing when the accident needs to be investigated.","42: Pilot suicide. Disabled the black boxes so the insurance claim to their family gets paid.  Suicide voids life insurance.","43: Juan Brown, who is a pilot, retired Air Force, now Commercial, has more details on the 737-800 electrical system on his channel  https://youtu.be/0CgO01n1px0?si=d1foSCJY6ZDbW9K7","44: Korean here, the airport is covering it up because they are liberal controlled area.

Someone popped the blackbox fuse. We do that only when testing the system. Fishy.","47: No battery power??? Seems unbelievable. Aren't these boxes supposed to emit regular \"pings\" days after a crash, to help localize the plane?","48: It is sad and disappointing, but not shocking. I was totally expecting this to be the case and I even mentioned it since day one in a couple of internet aviation forums.\nWe knew since day 1 that the plane stopped broadcasting the ADS-B data (i.e. the \"radar\" data shown by the airplane tracking sites) on the first approach at an altitude of 900 ft, more or less at the point where it started to go around. There are several things that can cause this, from a mistake with the pilot accidentally turning the transponder off when trying to input the emergency code (7700), to a failure of the transponder or ADS-B transmitter. But we knew that the plane hit birds (the pilot reported it and we saw the flames from the compressor stall in the video), we knew that they were in a lot of rush to land, and the non-extension of flaps could be an indication of hydraulic issues. In that context, a very good candidate as a cause of the interruption of broadcasting of ADS-B data was loss of the electrical systems. The electrical systems are fed by two engine-driven generators and an APU driven generator. The APU was most certainly off (it always is in flight, unless turned on due to ab abnormal situation) so the loss of the electrical systems would mean that both engine-driven generators likely failed, which in turn could be an indication of total or partial failure in both engines (which drive the generators). There is a battery-powered essential electrical bus, but that feeds very few things that are critical to keep the plane under control. For example, it powers the Captain's flight instruments, but not the first officer's. It powers only one communication radio, but not the other one. And it doesn't power the transponder, ADS-B transmitter and, you guessed it, the CVR and FDR.","49: If the south koreans would be stupid enough to try and cover something up here, is it safe to say, only they are stupid enough to make the mistake they are trying to cover up? So just stay out of their country and of their planes and thus be safe? Can it be that simple?","50: I am Korean.

The crew continued the approach as planned.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #1:\nPassive warning: ATC did not issue clear commands to avoid the bird strike, leaving the decision entirely to the crew.\nGraph:\nNo significant changes in the yellow line (vertical rate); the aircraft continued its normal descent.\n08:58L - Bird Strike\nEvent:\nThe aircraft encountered a flock of birds, with multiple birds striking the right engine and damaging its fan blades. The engine remained operational but likely showed signs of instability (vibrations or power fluctuations).\nThe crew declared a Mayday and began assessing the damage.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #2:\nThe crew decided not to continue the landing on Runway 01, even though it might have been possible to land with a partially damaged engine.\nGraph:\nThe yellow line dips slightly, indicating the aircraft briefly leveled off or slowed its descent as the crew assessed the situation.\n08:59L - Go-Around with Both Engines\nEvent:\nThe crew initiated a go-around, increasing thrust on both engines. The damaged right engine was heavily loaded during this maneuver.\nThe additional load caused the right engine’s fan to fail completely, leading to:\nA compressor stall, visible as flames and sputtering in video evidence.\nGenerator failure, reducing electrical system capacity.\nA significant loss of thrust from the right engine.\nThe left engine became the primary thrust source.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #3:\nThe decision to go around placed excessive strain on the damaged right engine, causing it to fail completely.\nGraph:\nThe yellow line (vertical rate) rises steeply, showing the increased thrust from both engines during the initial go-around. It levels off near the top as the right engine loses power.\n09:00L - Left Engine Shutdown\nEvent:\nThe crew shut down the left engine, potentially due to smoke in the cabin or a misdiagnosis of the situation, assuming the right engine was still partially functional.\nThe shutdown resulted in:\nTotal electrical failure, as the left engine’s generator stopped. Critical systems, including hydraulics, were powered only by the battery.\nHydraulic system limitations, preventing the extension of flaps and landing gear unless manually deployed.\nThe aircraft remained partially controllable but without the ability to adjust flaps or landing gear hydraulically.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #4:\nThe left engine shutdown sealed the situation, as the aircraft was left without sufficient power for full system functionality.\nGraph:\nADS-B data transmission ceases at this point due to the loss of electrical power.\n09:01L - Preparing for Landing Without Gear or Flaps\nEvent:\nThe aircraft was approaching Runway 19 with no landing gear or flaps extended, as these systems had not been deployed manually.\nThe crew focused on maintaining control of the aircraft using limited hydraulic systems supported by the battery.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #5:\nThe failure to manually deploy the landing gear and flaps resulted in an uncontrolled landing attempt, making it nearly impossible to stop the aircraft safely.\n09:03L - Crash into the Embankment\nEvent:\nThe aircraft slid across Runway 19 without landing gear or flaps, relying on fuselage friction for deceleration.\nGround effect provided additional lift, making it difficult to reduce speed effectively.\nThe aircraft collided with a concrete-reinforced embankment, leading to catastrophic destruction.\nSwiss Cheese Hole #6:\nThe embankment’s reinforced concrete structure exacerbated the severity of the crash. A softer barrier might have mitigated the damage.\nGraph:\nNo data is available for this phase, but reports and video evidence confirm the sequence of events.\nSwiss Cheese Theory Holes\nATC Bird Warning Insufficient:\n\nThe bird activity warning did not result in clear instructions for the crew, such as a go-around or diversion to Runway 19.\nCrew Decision to Abandon Landing on Runway 01:\n\nThe crew opted for a go-around instead of continuing the landing, which might have been safer despite the engine damage.\nGo-Around Decision:\n\nThe go-around placed significant stress on the damaged right engine, causing it to fail completely.\nLeft Engine Shutdown:\n\nShutting down the left engine led to a total electrical failure and reliance on limited battery power for critical systems.\nFailure to Manually Deploy Gear and Flaps:\n\nThe crew did not deploy the landing gear and flaps manually, leading to an uncontrolled landing attempt.\nReinforced Concrete Embankment:\n\nThe embankment’s rigid structure increased the crash’s destructive impact, reducing survivability.\nKey Observations and Lessons\nThe bird strike was the first critical hole:\n\nATC’s passive approach and the lack of immediate action by the crew allowed the chain of events to begin.\nGo-around decision escalated the situation:\n\nWhile understandable, the go-around decision placed undue stress on the damaged right engine, triggering its complete failure.\nManual intervention could have mitigated the outcome:\n\nExtending the landing gear and flaps manually might have allowed for a more controlled landing, even with limited hydraulic power.\nConcrete embankment exacerbated the crash:\n\nA softer, energy-absorbing barrier could have reduced the severity of the crash.\nThis timeline demonstrates how each step of the event chain corresponds to a Swiss Cheese Theory \"hole,\" leading to the tragic outcome.","40: No atc tapes.

I was totally expecting this to be the case and I even mentioned it since day one in a couple of internet aviation forums.\nWe knew since day 1 that the plane stopped broadcasting the ADS-B data (i.e. the \"radar\" data shown by the airplane tracking sites) on the first approach at an altitude of 900 ft, more or less at the point where it started to go around. There are several things that can cause this, from a mistake with the pilot accidentally turning the transponder off when trying to input the emergency code (7700), to a failure of the transponder or ADS-B transmitter. But we knew that the plane hit birds (the pilot reported it and we saw the flames from the compressor stall in the video), we knew that they were in a lot of rush to land, and the non-extension of flaps could be an indication of hydraulic issues. In that context, a very good candidate as a cause of the interruption of broadcasting of ADS-B data was loss of the electrical systems. The electrical systems are fed by two engine-driven generators and an APU driven generator. The APU was most certainly off (it always is in flight, unless turned on due to ab abnormal situation) so the loss of the electrical systems would mean that both engine-driven generators likely failed, which in turn could be an indication of total or partial failure in both engines (which drive the generators). There is a battery-powered essential electrical bus, but that feeds very few things that are critical to keep the plane under control. For example, it powers the Captain's flight instruments, but not the first officer's. It powers only one communication radio, but not the other one. And it doesn't power the transponder, ADS-B transmitter and, you guessed it, the CVR and FDR.","49: If the south koreans would be stupid enough to try and cover something up here, is it safe to say, only they are stupid enough to make the mistake they are trying to cover up?

The quest for answers aims to ensure the safety and well-being of air travelers worldwide. Often painted black to be easily spotted amidst wreckage, these black boxes are actually bright orange; they're designed to withstand extreme impacts in temperatures, preserving vital information about a flight's final moments. The flight data recorder meticulously tracks parameters like altitude, speed, and direction, providing investigators with a technical snapshot of the aircraft's performance. The cockpit voice recorder captures conversations and sounds within the cockpit, including pilot communication, alarms, and any other noises that might offer insight into events leading up to an incident or accident. In the case of the Chedu Air crash, data from these two sources painted a perplexing picture: the flight data recorder indicated that the pilot had initiated a go-around procedure—a standard maneuver where a landing attempt is aborted in favor of circling around for another try. This usually happens due to unstable weather, traffic on the runway, or technical issues. However, the cockpit voice recorder lacked any confirmation from the pilots regarding the go-around. The discrepancy between these two black boxes is at the heart of the investigation: did the flight data recorder malfunction, creating a false record?

Minutes before the crash, the control tower at Muan International Airport received a chilling transmission—a Mayday call—from Chedu Air. The pilots reported a bird strike during their final approach; they believed it involved multiple birds and caused damage to the aircraft's engine. Facing a sudden emergency, the pilots bravely fought to regain control of the aircraft and bring it down safely. The presence of multiple bird carcasses on the runway later confirmed the pilot's initial report. The investigation is now focusing on understanding the extent of the damage caused by the bird strike and how it might have affected the plane's systems and the pilot's ability to control the aircraft. Adding to the complexity of the investigation, some experts have raised concerns about a concrete embankment near the end of the runway. While not directly in the flight path, its proximity has led to arguments regarding whether the pilots' attempt to avoid it after the bird strike might have inadvertently contributed to the crash. The timeline of the bird strike, Mayday call, and the initiation of the go-around procedure or lack thereof are all under intense scrutiny. Adding to this complexity is the presence of a concrete embankment near the end of the runway. Some experts suggest that its proximity might have created psychological pressure on the pilots, influencing their decisions during those crucial seconds. This aspect of the investigation is likely to be contentious. A thorough analysis of the aircraft's flight path, pilot actions, and simulations of different scenarios will be crucial in determining the validity of this argument. Ultimately, the investigation will determine whether the embankment was a contributing factor or merely a coincidental presence in this tragic event.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00741"},"video_id":"eZJ8Of-FeRo","title":"South Korea Plane Crash : How it Happened? #boeing","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJ8Of-FeRo","text":"The aircraft made a slight deviation in flight path and declared Mayday after hitting birds. It was instructed to make it go around and land on Runway 19 southward. At this moment, the airplane encountered another problem with the landing gear which did not open. Finally, the plane had to make a belly landing due to what was supposedly a landing gear failure because it hit in the middle of the runway and crashed into an elevated localizer antenna and concrete, erupting into a huge fireball. More details are all in the video ahead. Juu Airflight 2216 was meant to be a routine domestic flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The total flight time was approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes, and the aircraft in use was a Boeing 737-800. The Boeing 737 is a very popular twin-engine medium-range commercial airliner. On this flight, it was operated by two pilots and four flight attendants, carrying a total of 175 passengers. It's important to note that the Boeing 737-800 part of the Next Generation series of 737 aircraft is different from the one in the video. The original layout about a plane control surface: It has ailerons at each wing tip that move opposite one another to roll the plane, and elevators at the tail that affect pitch. The rudder controls yaw or rotation. We'll also take a look at why the tail survived while the rest of the plane was destroyed from a top-down view. Two surviving crew members can be seen seated in the rear jump seats. In short, there's a myth that survival is linked to seat placement; those near the tail have statistically considered the safest during aviation accidents according to a 2015 study by Time Magazine, which analyzed 35 years of data from the Federal Aviation Administration. Rear seats had a fatality rate of 32% compared to 39% for those seated in the middle and 38% for those in the front. Both survivors were found in a state of shock. Lee, who suffered a fractured left shoulder and head injuries, was pulled from the wreckage despite the severity of their injuries. She was reported to be conscious and repeatedly asked rescuers what happened and why she was there. The old frequent flyer adage holds that sitting at the back of the plane is safer than sitting at the front. The wreckage of both Aerian Airlines flight 8243 and Juu Airflight 2216 seems to support this notion. In the case of the Aerian Airlines flight, an Embraer 109 was struck by a pancard air defense missile. The plane managed to land on its belly and skid off the runway.","comments":["0: Made in Blender( Free Software)\nPlease Subscribe","1: Typical AI slop, can't even say names correctly.","2: Sloppy report and video.

He didn't but himself any time doing such a tight turnaround. I'm not a pilot myself, but that seems reckless or inexperienced to me. I think the TRAINING is to blame.\n3) Why didn't they have an arresting system or just a dirt ramp before that concrete wall? That would have robbed the plane of energy without so much destruction.\n4) Airplane design probably contributed to confusion. They possibly turned off the good engine.

That mound was placed to bring the ILS localiser back to level where it must be located.\n\nNormal landing speed is about 140-160 knots depending on weight, the aircraft left the runway, dropped to the mound height, and hit the mound, if this mound didn't stop it, the speed may have been enough for the aircraft to leave the boundaries of the airport, and then hit the approach lights, causing almost the same damage. \n\nThese aircraft are designed to ingest a bird of up to 18 kg, that's a large bird, the engines are designed to take this damage and continue to work, one engine flying is still very safe for a 737-800, now if two engines were out, the APU is started to supply the power needed for all electrical systems, it is very rare for a dual engine failure. \n\nThat said, from the time they declared a mayday roughly 2 NM from the runway, to the time they hit the mound was 3-5 minutes, this is in no way enough time for the go around and line up to the other end of the runway, then preform a engine shutdown checklist, the APU start checklist, and emergency landing checklist. \n\nIn my opinion this landing was rushed, checklists were not performed, the APU was not started (10 minutes alone for that) and if they lost electrical power the landing gear couldn't be lowered.

Bird strike the right engine. Pilot called mayday and went around. Video showed the other engine seems off. This time the flap wasn't down means the plane landing about 200 knots higher than normal landing speed of 140 knots. At that time, the hydraulic system was still functioning. Most likely the pilot was in panic without lower flap and landing gear. With flap in cruising position, there won't be landing gear warning.

It is very weird since a lot of people and even experts that the black box recorder has it's own battery to record data of the flight especially in times of accident. So we can hardly say what really happened during that time.","75: I've watched the video of the accident, the speed of the airplane was very high.

Multiple ways to extend Flaps and Slats also. Both enable MUCH slower landing speed. BRAKES also have multiple back-ups that could have stopped acft IF the crew would have lowered the Landing Gear... PILOTS possibly shut WRONG engine down too! Also if the crew had performed a STANDARD 1 ENGINE GO-AROUND and landed in correct direction, they would NOT have plowed into the localizer berm that shredded acft. There was NO-WAY the Pilots had time to complete EMERGENCY CHECKLISTS either! Airport also had NO speed reducing Over-run Traps to slow/stop acft... EVERYTHING WAS DONE WRONG by PILOTS AND AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION!","92: Almost all wrong.  The pilot initiated the go around.   Go around from a landing approach is TOGA, flaps 15, positive rate “gear up” followed by flap retraction at 1000’ afl to a clean wing.   Once climbing with a clean wing, the PF would call for the “engine sever damage” checklist”.  Somewhere in the process, the crew was aware of not making sufficient thrust and tried to pull a rabbit out of a hat with a tear drop and opposite direction return.   Be clear, the tower gave them the airport to do whatever they needed.  The tower didn’t direct anything, as that decision was the Captain’s.   For what ever reason with the #2 engine suffering compressor stall, the #1 either quit or was shut down.   That forced the teardrop opposite direction return and the gear and flaps were up as they just tried to make it to a landing surface.  \n\nThe Red Box for duel engine failure really doesn’t work once core RPM decreases below 12%, which happens in seconds when slow.  The only way you’ll ever get an engine running is to start the APU, open the APU bleed, and use the Ground position on the start switch which uses APU air to turn the core via the starter motor.   In this situation., the expanded checklist is way too clunky and slow to get completed before ground contact.  For me, this was my personal Red Box item.  This came from my F16 experience where we were the masters of the air start.","93: How is Bangkok (Thailand) to Jeju (Korea) a domestic flight?","94: The engine seen to the left is the RIGHT engine.

This is an unverified video showing a plane being struck by birds as captured in this low-quality footage of the aircraft flying over the airport. The first screen grab from the video shows what appears to be two small flashes of white smoke emerging from both engines just milliseconds before the left engine ingests a bird. Due to the poor quality of the video, it is difficult to determine whether these flashes are simply engine smokes or indicate that both engines may have ingested birds. This is the actual footage capturing a dramatic moment where the plane executed a belly landing without its landing gear deployed. As a result, friction between the aircraft's fuselage and the runway caused intense smoke and sparks, eventually leading to visible fire emanating from the plane. While the pilot demonstrated remarkable skill in handling the situation, the Landing might have been significantly smoother if not for the localizer antenna position at the end of the runway.

He has organized the Cabinet with individuals favourable to him, even if they lack competence. The reinforced concrete foundation and upper plate applied to the Localizer Antenna were implemented during his administration. \n\nDespite both engines failing due to a bird strike, the pilot executed an impressive belly landing. The footage clearly shows their utmost effort until the very end. The blame for this disaster lies entirely with the Yoon administration.","6: Domestic flight?","7: I like your graphics.","8: Click bait","9: Maintenance team could probably be the guys who would be thrown under the bus next!","10: This was not a domestic flight as you said in the video..This was in international flight ..

What exactly are the aviation qualifications of the producer of this video?  The verbal description of the actual event by the narrator SCREAMS ignorance of basic aviation knowledge.  Others have pointed out, and I believe them to be correct, that ATC (Air Traffic Control) did NOT instruct the pilot to \"Go Around\".  This is an important factor.  The pilot initiated the \"Go Around\" which is that pilot's prerogative.\n\nIt is incorrect to refer to a runway designated, as in this case as 19, as \"nineteen\".  The correct designation is \"One-Niner\" or \"One-Nine\".  Runways are designated according to their orientation relative to magnetic north; usually rounded up to the closest 1/10.  A runway lined up, aligned, with 190-195 degrees would be usually designated as runway \"one-nine\" or \"one-niner\".  The reciprocal, opposite end of the same runway, would have a magnetic course of 013, and would be designated as runway 01 (one) or (zero-one).\n\nI could not get much beyond 4 minutes in this video before moving on.

Multiple ways to extend Flaps and Slats also. Both enable MUCH slower landing speed. BRAKES also have multiple back-ups that could have stopped acft IF the crew would have lowered the Landing Gear... PILOTS possibly shut WRONG engine down too! Also if the crew had performed a STANDARD 1 ENGINE GO-AROUND and landed in correct direction, they would NOT have plowed into the localizer berm that shredded acft. There was NO-WAY the Pilots had time to complete EMERGENCY CHECKLISTS either! Airport also had NO speed reducing Over-run Traps to slow/stop acft... EVERYTHING WAS DONE WRONG by PILOTS AND AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION!","92: Almost all wrong.  The pilot initiated the go around.   Go around from a landing approach is TOGA, flaps 15, positive rate “gear up” followed by flap retraction at 1000’ afl to a clean wing.   Once climbing with a clean wing, the PF would call for the “engine sever damage” checklist”.  Somewhere in the process, the crew was aware of not making sufficient thrust and tried to pull a rabbit out of a hat with a tear drop and opposite direction return.   Be clear, the tower gave them the airport to do whatever they needed.  The tower didn’t direct anything, as that decision was the Captain’s.   For what ever reason with the #2 engine suffering compressor stall, the #1 either quit or was shut down.   That forced the teardrop opposite direction return and the gear and flaps were up as they just tried to make it to a landing surface.  \n\nThe Red Box for duel engine failure really doesn’t work once core RPM decreases below 12%, which happens in seconds when slow.  The only way you’ll ever get an engine running is to start the APU, open the APU bleed, and use the Ground position on the start switch which uses APU air to turn the core via the starter motor.   In this situation., the expanded checklist is way too clunky and slow to get completed before ground contact.  For me, this was my personal Red Box item.  This came from my F16 experience where we were the masters of the air start.","93: How is Bangkok (Thailand) to Jeju (Korea) a domestic flight?","94: The engine seen to the left is the RIGHT engine.

A minister responsible for aviation safety feels a heavy responsibility for this disaster and is discussing appropriate actions, including potential resignation. The investigation into the crash has been significantly hampered by the loss of data from the final 4 minutes of flight recordings, which occurred after a Mayday call was issued but before the aircraft hit a concrete structure. Investigators are now focusing on several key questions:\n\n1. Why did the pilot feel the need to make such a quick landing instead of going around and landing in the intended direction? 2. Given that bird strikes typically do not cause malfunctioning of landing gears, why were they not deployed?

A troubling issue with the aircraft's black boxes has been revealed by GE employment: both cockpit voice recorders (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) stopped working approximately 4 minutes before the crash. While US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) further analyzed the devices, incorporating the findings that crucial data from the last minute of the flight was missing.

Now there have been a confirmation from South Korean officials that the CVR and FDR stopped recording approximately 4 minutes before the crash.

The thing I’m having trouble with is that the aircraft didn’t lose any significant speed from touchdown until departing the end of the runway. They were sliding on the engines nacelles - metal on concrete - for at least 5000 feet. That’s a lot of friction so you’d think they’d be doing less than the estimated 150 knots when they reached the end of the runway. \n\nFrom the video it sounded like the engines were producing significant thrust the whole way. It makes me wonder whether they were trying to go around again - either because they realized they’d overshot the landing touchdown point or because they overlooked putting the gear down in the emergency, realized their mistake late and were trying to go around from first contact. Or some combination of the two. \n\nGround effect will cause the plane to float prior to touchdown but with the flaps up you’re not going to get a pronounced effect from the air cushion the way you would with the flaps down. The extra speed could hurt you but the technique in an emergency with limited runway ahead would be to plant the plane on the ground rather than bleed off the speed.\n\nOnce you get metal on concrete and are shedding parts off the bottom of the engines and aft fuselage that normally generates very good deceleration. It’s just shocking they got to the end of the runway with that much energy. Tragic.","42: Don't take Boeing.","43: As a disclaimer, I will say this is speculation, however, I flew in the Asian region as a contract pilot for an airline for eight years.  I can unequivocally say the area has a problem with training its pilots as system operators and not aviators.  Instructors placed more emphasis on wrote memorization, and the speed of which procedures were accomplished versus being thorough ￼ and understanding of the situation.  \n\n￼Case in point, the ATR 72 that crashed in Taiwan after the crew could not identify which engine had failed and rushed to secure the operating engine.\n\nAlmost every training session in the simulator while working in the region was an exercise of slow down and evaluate which conflicted heavily with the culture.￼\n\nA bird strike may have caused an engine failure, but ultimately losing one engine is an abnormal that we practice for a lot.\n\nMy guess once the report is issued, the non-normal event that subsequently happened after the bird strike was mismanaged by the Flight crew and ultimately rushed to a conclusion that resulted in a gear up flap up landing.￼\n\n￼￼","44: Very tragic","45: This\"event\" is full of questions...as to even being real at all....","46: If both engines are compromised, there will be injuries and fatalities even given the best conditions unless it was a complete miracle. I think it is easy to blame the pilots who are now dead. I don't think they wanna die or intentionally want to crash land the plane. Those Einsteins that built the concrete wall there are responsible for many deaths. More would be alive if the plane didn't explode there.","47: Ryanair had a bird strike incident in rome (flight 4102) and they made a go around decision as per their training after landing being in doubt, which resulted in dual engine failure and a stall into the runway, everyone survived, but Boeing advised that training was updated to instruct pilots to continue landing even after a bird strike if close to the runway, so would be interesting to see here if that training existed in jeju airlines and if it was followed, outcome may have been different","48: Zelensky on e bike","49: Why, why to that barrier, the pilot was already safely on the ground...may all those lovely souls RIP","50: i have just watched 100's of videos on this and have come to the conclusion..Even if the berm was frangible..people would have died.  1 person's death does not mean the situation would be less tragic.

The lack of landing gear active made him go too fast and have more dificulty to pass the ground air cushion and ended landing too late.

Perhaps there was a good reason but it is something to wonder about.  We shall see what the data and cvr shows.","59: Simply doesn’t make sense. The aircraft had at least one engine on. You can hear it if you watch some videos of it. Also, why the intent to engage reversers as it can be seen on engine 2 if there is no thrust? \n\nAnother thing, coming in that fast, it should’ve been common sense for any pilot to deploy the gears (even using the gravity gear extension if there was no chance for a normal gear extension. It takes 15 seconds for it to deploy) as they would’ve created some drag and slowed the plane down. Any airline captain should be able to estimate the right time to deploy the gear in case of a dual engine loss. \n\nWith the back-up hyd system they should’ve also been able to deploy the leading edge flaps. \n\nI feel so sorry for the people on board as this situation could’ve been managed way better with the procedures that are in place nowadays.\n\nEven though I might get hate on this comment, this is poor piloting and poor decision making.","60: Why the didnt use the rudder left or right to avoid the colision with the wall","61: I will henceforth book seats at the tail end but a few seats away from the stinking toilet.","62: years ago, the JAL flight crash at haneda airport, 2 female attendants alive as they were at the tail end of the plane.","63: this incident indicates stupidity of South Korean runway designers. even a third world country doesn't make such stupid mistake to put a reinforced concrete wall along the path of commercial jetliner runway. this is the most stupid air crash ever that shouldn't have happened at all, even a child knows the danger associated with a reinforced wall along the runway. this incident absolutely requires criminal investigation of officials involved. so-called advanced country but incidents coming one after another, Sewol ferry disaster and this plane catastrophe.","64: It's just utterly heartbreaking and devastating 💔 to see .

This allows air brakes.","67: I think the biggest reason why this happened is it appears to me the pilots rushed things. When you have an emergency you slow things down. You think through the problems. You carefully follow the QRH. Unless you have an out of control fire/smoke or double engine failure you always have time to prepare for your emergency landing. Don’t know what started the sequence of events, but it ended like this because they rushed.","68: Best and most plausible explanation I've heard to date.","69: This woman does not know anything about aviation, and the so call expert is not an expert. \nBird strikes happen all the time, engines are designed to handle bird strikes, engines on this plane are design to allow the plane to fly and land with only one engine, at worse case. \nThey are dancing around what truly happened. Lets not overlook that only after they hit the wall that the plane was destroyed.","70: Spies bought poiticians to make bunker size walls. It was covered to look like a mound of dirt. They can't be that stupid to not  place  localizers on flexible structures.  Korea is still at war with North and its surrounding communist nations always seeking to take over. It is a testament to Koreans to have lived and worked to develop its nation under trying circumstances/geographical location.

They are in disarray.","71: I’m not a native speaker and I don’t get one thing he was explaining: okay there was a bird strike on the 1st landing approach and they had to cancel it and turn around for a second attempt. For that reason they didn’t drop the gear down to not to add any air drag knowing they have to turn around on just one engine, but then if they knew they’ve got second/last chance to land why there was no flaps, no airbrakes and no attempt to drop the gear down manually??? That plane was flying insanely fast at the of the runway… Can someone explain in simple words how this was explained by that commenting guy?","72: Being advised about bird activity at an airport is about as boiler plate basic as it gets.

And the authority and pilot should have been aware. \r\nThe decision pilot made to reverse land and air traffic controller agreeing to this is what shocked me coz they both should be aware of the presence of wall and the risk of reverse landing. I am not accounting the landing gear failure yet but if they are both aware of its not operating since before making decision, this is the worst decision both pilot and traffic controllers signals. \r\nThe wall is there, you cannot simply land from north. you cannot go through centre line etc. that should have been understood if you clearly think just one step forward.

They came from a long flight of many hours and did not have enough fuel to complete all the checklists","83: I think this is aircraft crash test…why would they build a wall there?","84: Pilot error 99%.  1 engine offline, possible smoke in cockpit or cabin, pilots panicked, turned off wrong engine, became a fast glider, no landing gear, dead.","85: Even if that burm wasn't there the plane was traveling so fast it would have smashed into the outer airport security wall and the outcome would of been exactly the same. Let's stop talking about the ils antenna wall and really investigate and get into what the hell the pilots were doing and thinking and saying. This is clearly pilot error in the fact that they obviously handled the single engine bird strike issue poorly. Once the cockpit voice recorder data is extracted we will know exactly what happened.","86: I am typed in the 737 and 767. I will be the first to say to look at the quality of training of the Jeju pilots. CRM and TEM in Asian carriers are often very poor. Many accident studies have shown these airlines have subordinate First  Officers who are intimidated into going with the Captains decisions even though they have  operational safety concerns and conflict with the Captains decision. Please look at Jeju 502, 12 August 2007. That crew overshot the runway at Gimhae International Airport. In March 2022, the Ministry of Land. Infrastructure and Transport of South Korea halted flights because they failed to follow safety protocol.\n\nFrom the video, it appears that it wasn't a concrete wall. It was a berm with the ILS system mounted on top of it. Either way, if they managed to ride over that, they would then be colliding with the wall next. \n\nAn EMAS (Engineered Materials Arresting System) at the end of the runway should have been put in place.\n\nWhat is confusing is that the video showed a puff of smoke from the right engine. But on landing, the right engine appears to be operating maybe marginally (you are able to see the heat signature in the video right before touchdown and the right thrust reverser was deployed but not the left). Did they incorrectly shut down the left engine? This happened to the 737 crew on Midland Airways Flight 092. They shut down the wrong engine. The pilots in TransAsia rushed and did not follow proper procedure. The Captain commanded the First Officer to shut down the incorrect engine. \n\nThe Jeju pilots would have right engine driven hydraulic pumps if it was still operating and electric driven pumps. They could have extended the flaps, and the landing gear could have been manually extended. Having gear down would help them brake. If all this is correct, it suggests that the pilots and especially the captain did not resort to proper Boeing QRH procedures. A go around from an approach should have already had some flaps deployed. \n\nI would not be surprised if the investigation pointed to the crew rushing to land the jet w/o compliance to QRH and landing checklist. I doubt that it was a dual engine failure as the RAT (Ram Air Turbine) was not seen deployed in any part of the video.","87: News reporters are so stupid about aviation.  It looks like the pilots panicked, didn't go through the emergency checklists, landed too quickly, forgot the gear, approached too fast in an unstable panicked approach, got caught in some ground effect due to the high approach speed, landed way too long, had no brakes, skidded off the runway at race car speeds and ran into a very poorly designed ILS tower and berm off the end of the runway and exploded.  I believe this started with a manageable single engine bird strike and ended about 7 minutes later in disastrous pilot error.  Everybody RIP.  😢","88: yet a plane just like this one went through many reinforced steel columns during 9-11.... so weird.","89: Not sure where CNN gets these \"experts\". Guy keeps talking about both engines being out but the video clearly shows one engine running. You hear the engine in one of the videos and can see the exhaust.","90: maybe better to upgrade the checklist imagine reading the booklet or finding the correct one  at the time of the crisis. why they develop a monitor that show problem then they run checklist will show step b step what to do. that easy to the pilot.","91: Question, did the 2 people survive did they have their phones out for video recording","92: I think pilots lost control went into freak out mode rather then going thru check list.","93: Do you know any other airport where they build a CONCRETE WALL of this size to support localizer antennas? Any runway overrun, like in an late abort of Take Off on RWY 19, would produce the same sad result.","94: No pilots name? No CVR ? No FDR ? Big cover up likely! (Pilot shutdown good engine)","95: I can't believe it's not an international requirement to not have concrete walls at the end of runways","96: Aerospace engineer here. It is a requierement for engines to survive bird strikes. There is literally a test where you need to throw a bunch of raw chickens to the engines at full speed and they must keep going to pass. Bird strikes are fairly common. It's very disorienting that they lost 2 engines to this, could be very bad maintenance.\n\nAlso, a failure mode of landing gears is the mechanism getting stuck. They could have also run out of time to deploy. I think those 2 are more likely than the crew just not deploying it.","97: that damn concrete F'd up everything.","98: It's NOT the same as Sully, girl! Sully lost BOTH engines.","99: Ok, so maybe they lost engine no 2 through a bird strike and shut down engine no 1 by mistake, it happened to British Midland Airways Flight 092 at Kegworth."],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00747"},"video_id":"EG8u50HM9t4","title":"Final 4 Minutes Missing: Black Boxes Fail in South Korea Plane Crash Investigation.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG8u50HM9t4","text":"The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-800 operated by JER. The crash occurred in the South Korean town of Muan on December 29th. The plane's landing gear failed to deploy properly, leading to a runway skid collision with a concrete structure and a subsequent fire that engulfed the aircraft. Of the 181 people on board, only two managed to survive. Initially, South Korean authorities conducted a preliminary examination of the black boxes but soon discovered missing data; as a result, the devices were sent to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for a more detailed analysis. The NTSB confirmed that both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) ceased recording data 4 minutes before the crash. The cause of this data failure remains unclear. Flight data and cockpit voice recorders are essential tools for modern aviation accident investigations; the FDR logs crucial flight parameters such as altitude, speed, engine performance, and control surface positions, while the CVR captures audio from the cockpit, including pilot conversations, alarms, and background noises. These recordings often provide critical clues in reconstructing the events leading up to an accident. In this case, the absence of data from the final four minutes of the flight has raised concerns about the reliability of the recording devices and the overall investigation process. However, the South Korean Transportation Ministry emphasized that accident investigations rely on multiple sources of evidence, including eyewitness testimonies, radar data, and physical wreckage examination. The ministry remains committed to determining the cause of the crash, despite the data limitations. Air traffic controllers reportedly warned the pilot about possible bird strikes 2 minutes before the plane issued a distress signal; the pilot confirmed a bird strike incident, prompting an emergency landing attempt. The sequence of events leading from the bird strike to the gear failure and ultimate crash remains a primary focus of the ongoing investigation. Following the accident, South Korean authorities have pledged to enhance airport safety measures to prevent similar tragedies. Aviation experts have drawn attention to the localizer system at Muan Airport as a contributing factor to the high death toll. The localizer part of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) assists pilots during landings by providing lateral guidance at Muan Airport. The localizer was housed in a concrete structure covered with dirt on an elevated embankment, which has sparked debate over whether the structure should have been made from lighter materials less hazardous during a crash. Some experts argue that structures like these should be designed with crumple zones or softer materials to reduce the risk of catastrophic damage in the event of an accident. This aspect of airport infrastructure safety will likely become a focus in South Korea's regulatory review following the crash. Beyond the structural concerns, the investigation is exploring aircraft mechanical systems maintenance records and crew training. Boeing 737-800 models have a solid safety record; however, previous incidents involving landing gear malfunctions have been noted. Investigators will examine whether technical issues, manufacturing defects, or inadequate maintenance contributed to the failure.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00748"},"video_id":"EG8u50HM9t4","title":"Final 4 Minutes Missing: Black Boxes Fail in South Korea Plane Crash Investigation.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG8u50HM9t4","text":"The surviving crew members and passengers will also provide crucial testimonies to reconstruct the final moments before the crash. Their statements combined with technical analysis and physical evidence will help paint a clearer picture of the events leading to the disaster. Aviation safety experts stress the importance of black-box reliability and data integrity. Modern aircraft are equipped with redundant systems to prevent data loss, making this incident unusual and concerning. The investigation's outcome could influence global aviation safety standards and lead to stricter requirements for flight data recording technology. In summer, the crash of the JU-52 Boeing 737-800 in Muan has highlighted significant concerns in aviation safety and accident investigation practices. The failure of the black boxes combined with structural safety issues at the airport has drawn global attention to the need for improved safety protocols and better accident prevention strategies. Authorities continue to investigate the precise causes of the crash, hoping to learn lessons that will prevent similar tragedies in the future.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f00749"},"video_id":"Pzb63Cqe2_k","title":"Jeju Air crash: What went on in cockpit will likely be known within 10 days, says analyst","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzb63Cqe2_k","text":"Well, thanks for joining us on a Friday evening. Jeffrey, I just want to touch on some of the latest news lines coming out where a pilot with seven years at Muan International says that he was never informed of the 2 high 4 meter thick concrete mount believed to have caused that explosion. And I'm curious to know what you think: Is it possible that something so large can possibly go unnoticed by experienced pilots? Look, it is very strange the comments that have been made because the the mound is where the localizer is and it has to be the localizer at that airport had to be elevated now for viewers, the localizer is a critical part of the instrument landing system. And at that airport, after the runway ends, the ground drops away, and the localizer has to be raised to be at a certain height. So that's why that structure is there. Now, there's a lot of confusion because in actual fact, the structure is 300 meters beyond the end of the technical end of the runway now I know the vision shows that part of that overrun is paved so people think it's part of the runway; it's not, it's part of the overrun. The question then would be: Well, maybe the overrun area should have been with the new EMASS (Engineered Material Arror System) sand or gravel something like that instead of a paved section of tarmac which would have obviously slowed the ER plane up far quicker than the existing overrun area. But does that airport comply with international standards?","comments":["0: Was it pilot suicide...???","1: The authorities declared that the blackbox stopped recording 4 minutes prior to the fatal crash.

There is a logo called Jeju Air, which actually has a window, but the accident video shows crude font and the letter r. \r\nIt was drawn incorrectly. I checked it several times. Another thing is that there is writing on the engine cover on a real airplane, but it is not in the accident video. I don't know English, so I translated it with a translator and uploaded it.","10: Already been 2 days and no answers! Lies!","11: He looks like tim cook!","12: Another expert that needs to do his research. EMAS works by the weight of the aircraft being transferred throgh the small contact points of the wheels to break up the surface. Its not designed to slow aircraft with the gear up and its debatable wether it would have slowed this aircraft down. If your going over about 70 knts it also wont slow you down, its not designed as a high speed stopping solution.","13: But why was the airplane \"speeding\" to land?","14: Why can't commercial planes have deployable landing parachutes like those on a fighter plane so that they can help reduce speed significantly in emergency landing situations. I'd sacrifice some cargo capacity in exchange for enhanced safety.","15: They had no chance, concrete wall or not - because just behind that wall is a dyke, a dam enclosing the whole south of the airfield. The road runs on top of that.","16: The concrete reinforced berm consistent with international standards?  That conflicts with a number of air inspector and pilot commentary.   Also, this analysis brought up the issue of climate change in a prior interview on the jeju crash.

I don’t want to say it’s intentional. But for someone who can see the big wall coming to collide at high speed, as a pilot I would attempt any measures to just to avoid the wall.

Without the concrete ILS “base”, the aircraft still needs fairly long distance to stop. Can anyone guarantee the aircraft can safely stop even without the concrete structure there?  If u look at the map, by extending 10,100 ft from the touch down location, it will be in the middle of the sea southern to the runway 19…","29: If a truck has a brake failure, it has still a chance to stop as long as there is a space to run in.

The real problem happened in the cockpit, and I find it very hard to understand why the pilot chose to land halfway down the runway at such high speed. While its likely that the airplane had serious technical issues, it was the pilot's actions that triggered the consequences. There were several miscalculations along the way","43: parece que a aviação não anda muito bem na foto com a galera lá de cima não, toda hora tem uma tragédia...ficam falando que os aviões estão cada vez mais modernos..seguros...blá-blá-blá..que só falta falar, tem tanta tecnologia que daqui a pouco nem vai precisar mais de piloto, mas o que temos vistos é que com todo esse progresso...toda essa tecnologia não adianta nada se não treinarem bem o homem, pois uma manobra errada tudo isso vira fumaça..escombros junto com as vidas das pessoas..te. erros primários que poderiam ser evitados com uma tripulação mais bem treinada...formada..muito triste","44: Are people this stupid to think that the wall is the problem?\nForget about the stupid wall, if not the wall it would have been the buildings next to the airport with people inside.\nWhat led to the plane landing like it did is the real problem...","45: The transcript isn’t going to be good seconds from hitting that wall 😔","46: are you sure this team is qualified to discuss  the issue and maybe start with we are sorry foe the loss","47: International standards are WRONG. THey must be changed immediately.","48: Why not have two or three powerful engines mounted on the bottom transitioning from high speed horizontal flight, to vertical helicopter like flight to make landing that much safer? Vertical thrusters along with emergency parachute deployment could make commercial planes infinitely safer. Birds fly into the side mounted jets? no problem, let's just activate the vertical thrusters. I hope Elon musk would make this happen, he's the only one that can make fast and effective change like this.","49: Singapore airline using 737-800 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur 🦋🦋","50: The head of Jeju airline are guilty of professional negligent by having incompetent's pilots.","51: Investigates the Boeing plane maintenance…","52: …the main reason why the Boeing plane even being landed successfully by the experience pilot on the runway, bcuz the plane landing gear & brakes system not working, the pilot can’t stop the speeding plane that’s why it crash into the concrete wall.","53: my theory that they  were attempting another go around after they realized they touched down with no gear. maybe the thrust reverser wasn't deployed, just the cowling got pulled back while skidding along the ground. that would explain the high speed and not slowing down, but they couldn't get quite enough power to lift off again.","54: If the localizer has to be raised, why a berm?   Why not material  designed to not blow up a plane?   Why didn’t the overrun area have the EMAS system?     If this is internationally approved it’s insane.

This man probably shares rssponsobility and is covering for himself.","64: Every experienced aviation professional I’ve heard so far… every.single.one …has declared that there is zero reason for that berm to be built. ie the ILS localizer, can simply be mounted flush with the ground, and with the aerials simply designed  to break away easily if impacted. \n\nThe big question : What is this gentleman’s agenda for trying to defend that big ol’ berm???","65: 1:52 There is ZERO chance that despite complying with standards, that any mound like that plane-destroying-bunker will be left in place after 2025","66: But he didn't answer the first question","67: I'm an expert on analyzing the experts.","68: At most western airports the ILS systems are just attached to posts that go into the ground so that if something hits them they will just fall away. Crazy to have the ils positioned on a concrete mound, apparently many eastern airports have the ILS on mounds that are bigger still. End of the day though that jeju air should not of been travelling at that speed off the end of the runway, no landing gear, no flaps, bonkers id say!","69: While the mound is what killed all of these people it's not the full story. This is going to all break down to multiple failures which all played a part. From the work culture at the airlines, to pilot error, to local government policy, to maintenance failure and even air craft design. There are probably different levels of failure on all of them.","70: Is there a possibility that the cockpit recorder transcripts can be manipulated?","71: We can be very confident that the NTSB will succeed in retrieving the full data from the DFDR. The Korean safety board likely only had the equipment to read the data from plugging it to the DFDR’s external data connector, which likely was damaged. The NTSB is capable of entirely disassembling the unit as thoroughly as needed, up to and including each memory chip, possibly even repairing damage to the chip’s pins, all this without risking damaging the data. They work extremely meticulously and have trained experts of this kind of forensic operation. Likely only a matter of weeks.","72: At the very high speed the aircraft was at the end of the runway, especially with a belly landing making the aircraft much more prone to sliding, an EMAS or slowing area would hardly have made any difference. \nThe aircraft would have crashed against the concrete perimeter wall behind the ILS berth anyway. It was really a very high speed runway overrun.","73: Why in the world would you pave the overrun area of the runway instead of making it of material that would slow the plane down, especially if you’re gonna put a massive concrete barricade right after that?","74: Yea everyone is pretty curious, though the flight data recorder had some issues and was to be sent to NTSB in Washington to get that data downloaded but the CVR has been analyzed, at least preliminarily.","75: There is nothing new in this report we don't already know.","76: Solid reporting and educational responses.","77: Why was he so angry?","78: Ma, se i piloti pensavano di fare un atterraggio pensando che fosse di terra il muro di cemento?","79: All the \"experts\" in the YouTube comments are hilarious - kindly shut the hell up.","80: I think he’s wrong.  Another pilot said whatever the localizer is built on, by law has to be frangible (easily broken).","81: Unfortunately, the pilot made very wrongful, grave and risky decision to land the plane on its belly without the landing gears! Even if the end of runway had no concrete wall or object, some of the passengers were also died instantly due to very heavy shock and impact when the plane belly hits the runway ground with an enormous force and unfortunately without the landing there was no shock absorber to cushion and absorb the very heavy impact!","82: He never said the word \"Concrete\" a material that will obliterate any type of aircraft if both collided.","83: This \"expert\" have been paid to protect the Airport managers.

If the elevation of such a structure is too low, it can be raised on metal posts and not a reinforced concrete berm.","90: THANKS!","91: This airport not comply with RESA300, both of runway 01 & 19.

Now I want to talk about South Korea's data extraction capabilities because it seems like there are limitations. And they've also made a decision to send the black boxes to the US. And I'm wondering how you think that will affect the investigation timeline. Well, my understanding was that the cockpit voice recorder had been downloaded in South Korea in Seoul and they were working on a transcript of that for release now. The next thing we heard was the digital flight data recorder which we knew was damaged had been taken to Washington to the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), the American investigator, and now we know that the cockpit voice recorder also is being taken to Washington now this is not unusual because they have all specialist equipment to analyze these two black boxes. But it may well be that the South Korean authorities do still release a transcript of the of the cockpit voice recorder but the Americans may well add some particular dynamics to that transcript, some more understanding of of some of the things that were going on in the cockpit, such as the sounds, alarms, and whatnot, trying to interpret it and trying to absolutely understand what challenges the pilots were facing. So, the South Korean transport ministry estimates a timeline of 6 months to 3 years you know based on what comes out of those black boxes is that a realistic timeline? Well, look in a typical air crash, first of all, every country like South Korea has to produce a report within 30 days now that report can simply say yes, the airplane crashed and tragically 179 people died. Just it needs to just say the basic facts. The interpretation of the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder can take many years in this case I do not believe it will take any anywhere near that amount of time. I think we will have an understanding of what went on in the cockpit within the next 7 to 10 days at least because in South Korea, the public is clamoring for answers; the government's under a lot of pressure to give answers because of other political imperatives that are going on in that country so I would suggest that within 7 to 10 days at the maximum we will have a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder and the other thing that's very important is to pass on to all the relevant authorities and other airlines any learnings from this particular tragedy, such as: \"How can we prevent similar accidents in the future?\" So, thanks so very much for your time and thoughts. Aviation analyst Jeffrey Thomas.","comments":["0: Was it pilot suicide...???","1: The authorities declared that the blackbox stopped recording 4 minutes prior to the fatal crash. Unbelievable!","2: That's crazy to have a brick wall  right off the.run way","3: \"The blackboxes are virtually indestructable\" It's a shame that they weren't on huh?\nWell, no data recovered now. Fantastic...","4: My Deepest Sympathy to all the Bereaved family 😢","5: Pls present the black box data at the earliest so we can find out all the problems with jeju air crash. why the pilot made a sharp u turn and landed 3/4 th way down the runway in the opposite direction... without flaps landing gear (and ofcourse the wall at the end muuch has been written about it) what was the emergency??","6: International standards has to be fired!!","7: Bird strikes is the main course this accident. Other all happened after that incident.","8: Bottom line, that wall killed 179 people. The localizer antennas could have been built and raised on towers anchored on a base designed to break away.","9: The Muan accident video is CG, and the evidence can be seen by comparing it with existing photos of the same model. There is a logo called Jeju Air, which actually has a window, but the accident video shows crude font and the letter r. \r\nIt was drawn incorrectly. I checked it several times. Another thing is that there is writing on the engine cover on a real airplane, but it is not in the accident video. I don't know English, so I translated it with a translator and uploaded it.","10: Already been 2 days and no answers! Lies!","11: He looks like tim cook!","12: Another expert that needs to do his research. EMAS works by the weight of the aircraft being transferred throgh the small contact points of the wheels to break up the surface. Its not designed to slow aircraft with the gear up and its debatable wether it would have slowed this aircraft down. If your going over about 70 knts it also wont slow you down, its not designed as a high speed stopping solution.","13: But why was the airplane \"speeding\" to land?","14: Why can't commercial planes have deployable landing parachutes like those on a fighter plane so that they can help reduce speed significantly in emergency landing situations. I'd sacrifice some cargo capacity in exchange for enhanced safety.","15: They had no chance, concrete wall or not - because just behind that wall is a dyke, a dam enclosing the whole south of the airfield. The road runs on top of that.","16: The concrete reinforced berm consistent with international standards?  That conflicts with a number of air inspector and pilot commentary.   Also, this analysis brought up the issue of climate change in a prior interview on the jeju crash.    Questionable relevance at face value.","17: The fact is no matter what happened, they all would have survived without the wall. Get rid of the wall","18: It would only slow it if the gear was  down.","19: REASONS for AIRCRAFT CRASHES\r\r\n\r\n(1) Weather. e.g. Heavy cloud or fog > Low visibility. Rain. Snow. Hail. High winds.

I don’t want to say it’s intentional. But for someone who can see the big wall coming to collide at high speed, as a pilot I would attempt any measures to just to avoid the wall. But in this case, it’s straight into the wall. The pilot did know its gonna explode and I wonder why he didn’t attempt to steer out. I am sorry to say that.","22: Talk about struggling to make news.

Just beautiful.","27: lol who is this","28: According to the “737-800 Quick Reference Manual”, with the landing gears down and breaking system (reverse, breaks, spoilers) full functional, it needs 10,100 ft of runway to stop the aircraft with 0 degree flaps! Without the concrete ILS “base”, the aircraft still needs fairly long distance to stop. Can anyone guarantee the aircraft can safely stop even without the concrete structure there?  If u look at the map, by extending 10,100 ft from the touch down location, it will be in the middle of the sea southern to the runway 19…","29: If a truck has a brake failure, it has still a chance to stop as long as there is a space to run in. For planes, is that impossible??? Flying is so so dangerous though.","30: I hear they actually wanted built an anti-aircraft battery there Decided otherwise due to high cost ","31: This structure to be compliant with international standards is simply wrong!","32: Taking that equipment to the US is a bad move. The US and the companies are so corrupt. They look to sue or to prevent being sued and only care about money. BAD move","33: I believe this Jeju Air jet is the first plane to overrun on the runway at Muan airport while making a gear-up landing.","34: This guy dodges the question: WHY use concrete to raise the localizer.","35: This is real good analyst, all the other analysts ikve heard were directly blabbing about the wall, overlooking some many facts. I would like to rais a serious concern regarding these Boeing 737-max or whatever. Why the that type of plane struggles, why isn't there anything done about it. It's a widely used model, why there's no actions are taken on this regard??\nThese planes need to undergo an international inspection not Boeing inspection, international inspection.","36: Is that an appropriate actual landing place for airplanes if it is why is there a wall???","37: All airlines are subject to accidents too. Need this expert","38: Here is an answer to what went on in the cockpit:  not 1 thing the crew had been trained to do.  Two person crews are trained on bird strikes, engine inop orocedures, engine inop landings, etc.  They are trained MERCILESSLY on standard, abnormal, and emergency procedures.  This crew did NONE of what their training had taught them.","39: Do airports have an emergency runway with a cable catching system like aircraft carriers use or something like it to help slow down the aircraft?","40: THAT AIRPORT COMPLIES WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARD'S? 179 PEOPLE ARE DEAD!\n\nSHUT THAT AIRPORT DOWN IT'S NOT SAFE FOR ANYBODY","41: They didn’t put down the landing gear.\nI live 11km from an international airport and the wheels are down before they get to me.\nThis plane was near the airport and the bird strike happened there.\nLanding gear wasn’t down.\n\nTotal pilot incompetences.\nThey could have avoided the crash had they not been so stupid.\n\nMy take, I’m not wrong.","42: The concrete wall wasn't the main issue. The real problem happened in the cockpit, and I find it very hard to understand why the pilot chose to land halfway down the runway at such high speed. While its likely that the airplane had serious technical issues, it was the pilot's actions that triggered the consequences. There were several miscalculations along the way","43: parece que a aviação não anda muito bem na foto com a galera lá de cima não, toda hora tem uma tragédia...ficam falando que os aviões estão cada vez mais modernos..seguros...blá-blá-blá..que só falta falar, tem tanta tecnologia que daqui a pouco nem vai precisar mais de piloto, mas o que temos vistos é que com todo esse progresso...toda essa tecnologia não adianta nada se não treinarem bem o homem, pois uma manobra errada tudo isso vira fumaça..escombros junto com as vidas das pessoas..te. erros primários que poderiam ser evitados com uma tripulação mais bem treinada...formada..muito triste","44: Are people this stupid to think that the wall is the problem?\nForget about the stupid wall, if not the wall it would have been the buildings next to the airport with people inside.\nWhat led to the plane landing like it did is the real problem...","45: The transcript isn’t going to be good seconds from hitting that wall 😔","46: are you sure this team is qualified to discuss  the issue and maybe start with we are sorry foe the loss","47: International standards are WRONG. THey must be changed immediately.","48: Why not have two or three powerful engines mounted on the bottom transitioning from high speed horizontal flight, to vertical helicopter like flight to make landing that much safer? Vertical thrusters along with emergency parachute deployment could make commercial planes infinitely safer. Birds fly into the side mounted jets? no problem, let's just activate the vertical thrusters. I hope Elon musk would make this happen, he's the only one that can make fast and effective change like this.","49: Singapore airline using 737-800 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur 🦋🦋","50: The head of Jeju airline are guilty of professional negligent by having incompetent's pilots.","51: Investigates the Boeing plane maintenance…","52: …the main reason why the Boeing plane even being landed successfully by the experience pilot on the runway, bcuz the plane landing gear & brakes system not working, the pilot can’t stop the speeding plane that’s why it crash into the concrete wall.","53: my theory that they  were attempting another go around after they realized they touched down with no gear. maybe the thrust reverser wasn't deployed, just the cowling got pulled back while skidding along the ground. that would explain the high speed and not slowing down, but they couldn't get quite enough power to lift off again.","54: If the localizer has to be raised, why a berm?   Why not material  designed to not blow up a plane?   Why didn’t the overrun area have the EMAS system?     If this is internationally approved it’s insane.    Bad CRM will be the ultimate result.","55: its a possibility that the captains windshield outer pane was shattered causing loss of vision","56: It’s ALREADY KNOWN!!!! It just hasn’t been RELEASED!!!","57: Pilot error poor judgement.","58: Pilot must've thought the mound will help stop the plane, but the great wall of jeju was too strong","59: why would they decode the black box recording for three years? I mean what do they need to do for 1000 days every day technically?","60: \"The quicker the information is disseminated, the better\".  I see.  Note that the US NTSB takes 2-3 years to publish their final accident feports.  ???","61: Could it be any more robotic than the way this Singaporean \"journalist\" was programmed to ask her questions??","62: We will know sheet...","63: Lol blatant liar, this man is lying to protect incompetence. All localizers must be colapsable. Many localizers at airports have to be elevated but are elevated by colapsable metal rods. This man probably shares rssponsobility and is covering for himself.","64: Every experienced aviation professional I’ve heard so far… every.single.one …has declared that there is zero reason for that berm to be built. ie the ILS localizer, can simply be mounted flush with the ground, and with the aerials simply designed  to break away easily if impacted. \n\nThe big question : What is this gentleman’s agenda for trying to defend that big ol’ berm???","65: 1:52 There is ZERO chance that despite complying with standards, that any mound like that plane-destroying-bunker will be left in place after 2025","66: But he didn't answer the first question","67: I'm an expert on analyzing the experts.","68: At most western airports the ILS systems are just attached to posts that go into the ground so that if something hits them they will just fall away. Crazy to have the ils positioned on a concrete mound, apparently many eastern airports have the ILS on mounds that are bigger still. End of the day though that jeju air should not of been travelling at that speed off the end of the runway, no landing gear, no flaps, bonkers id say!","69: While the mound is what killed all of these people it's not the full story. This is going to all break down to multiple failures which all played a part. From the work culture at the airlines, to pilot error, to local government policy, to maintenance failure and even air craft design. There are probably different levels of failure on all of them.","70: Is there a possibility that the cockpit recorder transcripts can be manipulated?","71: We can be very confident that the NTSB will succeed in retrieving the full data from the DFDR. The Korean safety board likely only had the equipment to read the data from plugging it to the DFDR’s external data connector, which likely was damaged. The NTSB is capable of entirely disassembling the unit as thoroughly as needed, up to and including each memory chip, possibly even repairing damage to the chip’s pins, all this without risking damaging the data. They work extremely meticulously and have trained experts of this kind of forensic operation. Likely only a matter of weeks.","72: At the very high speed the aircraft was at the end of the runway, especially with a belly landing making the aircraft much more prone to sliding, an EMAS or slowing area would hardly have made any difference. \nThe aircraft would have crashed against the concrete perimeter wall behind the ILS berth anyway. It was really a very high speed runway overrun.","73: Why in the world would you pave the overrun area of the runway instead of making it of material that would slow the plane down, especially if you’re gonna put a massive concrete barricade right after that?","74: Yea everyone is pretty curious, though the flight data recorder had some issues and was to be sent to NTSB in Washington to get that data downloaded but the CVR has been analyzed, at least preliminarily.","75: There is nothing new in this report we don't already know.","76: Solid reporting and educational responses.","77: Why was he so angry?","78: Ma, se i piloti pensavano di fare un atterraggio pensando che fosse di terra il muro di cemento?","79: All the \"experts\" in the YouTube comments are hilarious - kindly shut the hell up.","80: I think he’s wrong.  Another pilot said whatever the localizer is built on, by law has to be frangible (easily broken).","81: Unfortunately, the pilot made very wrongful, grave and risky decision to land the plane on its belly without the landing gears! Even if the end of runway had no concrete wall or object, some of the passengers were also died instantly due to very heavy shock and impact when the plane belly hits the runway ground with an enormous force and unfortunately without the landing there was no shock absorber to cushion and absorb the very heavy impact!","82: He never said the word \"Concrete\" a material that will obliterate any type of aircraft if both collided.","83: This \"expert\" have been paid to protect the Airport managers. He was VERY cautious to NOT TO MENTION THE CONCRETE MOUND THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!!! THE ANTENNAS COULD HAVE BEEN RAISED BY POLES!!","84: Jowls, facelift","85: tell us of more airports that comply with international standards in that way so we can AVOID THEM!","86: Horrible situation. My heart goes out to friend and family <3 May it have been without any suffering for the killed passangers <3 RIP <3 Love from Norway","87: was many plane crashes at same period of times in different areas for last weeks","88: Why are they not going after the person who authorized the construction of the WALL?","89: The first condition of all localizer antennae is, that it has to be frangible. If the elevation of such a structure is too low, it can be raised on metal posts and not a reinforced concrete berm.","90: THANKS!","91: This airport not comply with RESA300, both of runway 01 & 19.

No possible reason to skip this step except pilot error.

Jeju International Airport, like many others, does not have a runway overrun area, which is understandable. Despite this, hundreds of thousands of flights safely land and take off from Jeju, demonstrating the airport’s capability and the pilots’ proficiency. It is unreasonable to expect a large overrun area on such a small island, making the pilot’s actions the more plausible explanation for this unfortunate event.","47: Dear CNN news for the sake of my knowledge i would like to know why the plane didn't land in the sea like this emergency situation sea is the safest place for landing i think control tower should give the instructions to the flight captain but all the hard work of him in wain but still he gave his best with belly landing but poor fellow couldn't make it","48: So sad. May Their Souls  Rest in Peace","49: The pilot should go round and round first until he got the advice from the experts during that time.

In the original footage you can see white thing come out of the left engine again. Double engine bird strike?","62: There was no \"landing gear malfunction\". If there were, and the pilots understood this, there is no way on earth they would have set that plane down that fast halfway down the runway. Clearly they were far above approach speed in a non-stabilized approach with no flaps/slats deployed and felt they had to land. As far as I can see at this time, the pilots could have continued the approach even AFTER hitting the bird despite the stalled starboard engine - or at the worst gone around and attempted to either restart the stalled engine or land on one engine, which is perfectly doable (and practiced in the simulator). I think the pilots panicked and for whatever reason reconfigured the plane (no flaps/slats deployed despite being so when they hit the bird) and shortly thereafter elected to conduct a no flaps approach and forgot to put the gear down. There would have been all sorts of warning horns going off and they likely became overloaded/task-saturated when there was absolutely no reason to put themselves in that situation. Pilot error all the way.","63: V tragic ..Condolences to families …as an aviation expert ,apart from the possible bird strike ,I see serious pilot error ..","64: I think in this scenario they have to land on grassy land as compare to run way to get more  muddy friction, any ways a really heart breaking tragedy","65: No gear down is one thing but the flaps on wings are not in the extended or down position.

Korea has vital interest not to address the concrete wall and corruption in political system, so they will blame pilot as well. The problem with that particular 737 800 on route to china was engine related as far as i know. They didn't repaired the engine in 2 days, it is impossible, so we have good probability this flight flew with one failing engine in questionable shape and the other engine was possibly destroyed in the birdstrike. It explains video footage, with one engine backfiring and pumping (right engine) and the other engine completely still (left engine). In such situation Boeing has not any backup for many hydraulic systems including flaps and spoilers, hence the  high landing speed without flaps. As there was only one damaged engine available and it was destroyed completely after the touchdown, there was not thrust reverse so the doomed aircraft overshot the runway and ended in the concrete wall. It doesn't sound as a pilot mistake at all.","84: i think, bird got inside flaps and flaps didnt open, and pilot decided to land without flaps and without landing gears and kept high speed during landing to maintain lift as there are no flaps deployed","85: 韓国では他国では起こり得ない事件や事故が頻繁に起きる","86: Kids died to","87: R.I.P ALL","88: how engine damage connected with no wheel usage?","89: Who put the wall on the end of the runway","90: All the commercial aircraft must've two mega parachutes on the top of the plane and one at the tail end of the plane with auto function system..

There's got to be emergency exits with protection for all passengers, esp. at the tail area. How could they ran into death on the ground?

It appears a lot more people would have survived if they had not hit the barrier","95: If it's Boeing, I'm not going\n\nAnother Boeing. Another 737. They're really taking all the fucking publicity eh.","96: It's puzzling why the landing gear wasn't deployed manually if the hydraulics had been compromised. If the pilots forgot to deploy the landing gear then clearly they didn't do a 'bloody good job.' Some aviatoin experts are questioning why the pilot was in such a hurry to get the plane on the ground without giving airport fire crews time to lay foam on the runway to reduce friction and the rsik of fire. However, none of those likely would have prevented the almost total loss of life due to the concrete wall at the end of the runway. I have an acquaintance who's a 737-800 pilot and he said he had never seen any other airport with that. Landing/navigational lights are usually positioned in collapsible structures. It's totally irresponsible and should never have been allowed to be built there. Without the brick wall it's possible most if not all could have survived because the belly landing was textbook, correct nose attitude and wings level.","97: 助かった人の命がコンクリート壁によって失われた。コンクリートの壁がなく海に突っ込んだとしても、死者はこれほど増えなかったと思う。","98: Just condolences!","99: Nowhere in the U.S. are brick retainer walls installed at commercial airports at the end of a runway.  Instead, an aluminum or wood blast fence is situated at least 1000 feet from the end.  That is an FAA regulation.  I hope the South Korean aviation authority learns from this."],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f0074c"},"video_id":"0CgO01n1px0","title":"Missing Data! JeJu Air 737-800 UPDATE 11 Jan","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CgO01n1px0","text":"These critical last four minutes correlate with the fact that ADSB data was also missing for those last four minutes, indicating that the crew declared \"MayDay\" at 859 and the last word heard from them was around 859 to 903, roughly those last four minutes. This suggests a major electrical failure on board. I've been scouring Chris Brady's 737 technical website to find the exact power source of both the CVR and FDR. Thanks to some folks over on Patreon, I've narrowed it down to the AC transfer bus number one as the primary power source for both devices, with backup from AC transfer bus number two. In the design of the Boeing 737, these critical items are typically powered by an independent battery, which apparently predates FAA regulations requiring that FDR and CVR have their own independent batteries. Alternatively, they could be wired up to the backup emergency electrical system, such as the battery in the event of a loss of AC power. If the 737 loses both AC buses (left and right), the electrical system defaults to the battery or the standby electrical system via the hot battery bus, which is hardwired to the battery. The switched hot battery bus, battery bus, DC standby bus, and AC standby by bus are all connected through a static inverter. Unfortunately, if the flight data recorder (FDR) is not part of this backup system, we have no idea what systems remain operational in the aircraft. Remember that there's no RAT or Ram Air Turbine on the 737 design because it uses the battery as its backup power source. In this particular emergency, the crew did not have time to fire up the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to provide complete electrical power to the entire aircraft. All of this data is crucial for investigating exactly what happened during those last four minutes. The NTSB needs to figure out why these devices stopped recording before they can begin unraveling the exact circumstances of the accident. According to an article in Aviation Week, the Boeing 737-800's damaged flight recorder was sent to the NTSB for data extraction. However, when investigators realized some data was apparently missing from the CVR, it was sent back for further analysis. So, what happened to the critical four minutes of data on both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder? The NTSB needs to determine why these devices stopped recording before they can begin investigating exactly what occurred during this accident.

That is not critical to keeping the plane in the air. It is \"critical\" to our curiosity, not to the operation of the plane.   Don't confuse our wish list for importance.    The far less complicated systems in cars have super capacitors sufficient for a second or so of finishing up recording tasks.   Putting something as volatile and perishable as a battery inside the \"black boxes\" on planes would be a pretty terrible idea as it would be very difficult to maintain the integrity and durability of the boxes with a battery inside that could last four minutes or more.    It would be easier to stream a few critical bits live. However, that is what ADSB essentially does, and you are now whining for more.","8: I've always understood it that the battery isn't only for storing energy, but also to balance and/or provide a steady smooth power supply to a system.  Why wouldn't the batteries always be tied to the engines to smooth out the power supplied by the generators?","9: Missing data in terms of lost data or data not being there to begin with? If data is found corrupted is a different thing from finding a \"hole\" where data was expected to be found.\nBack in the days, it took some effort to completely make data disappear, including any signs of the data ever being there, Even a gap could potentially tell something, especially so wtih additional traces, loggs etc.\nNot having any experience on this gear though, just talking from other experiences from back in the days. Also, we had fail overs, redundant power sources and made an effort to not have single points of failures. Lab forensic could retreive data from various media being severly damaged both physically and in logical structure, usually much more retrival than most would have guessed. Clearly not having the full picture in this case... it feels confusing.","10: And this is why it is foolish to give opinions on accidents until the investigations get started and we learn real facts.  So many people were quick to accuse the pilots but it looks like something unexpected happen.  Think about this before you jump to conclusions.","11: Well, one way for Boeing to avoid criticism is to make sure equipment critical to determining causes of accidents fails during emergencies.","12: I think its time to add batteries to the CVR and FDR to ensure that these devices work for like 20 minutes even after a total power loss. Would that make these devices bigger and heavier? Of course, but i think it would be worth it.","13: What would the downside be if reported bird activity required pilots to preemptively start the APU.

That comes from experience, not the checklist.\n\nThe JeJu air pilots did the BEST they could and if it wasn't for that structure at the end of the runway, all of them would be alive. Zero doubt.\n\nShould pilots be trained to turn on the APU earlier in the checklist process?","25: They are torturing the families of the perished by first telling them more will be revealed in 10 days just to announce the crucial part (4 minutes, no decimals) is non-existent.","26: That's not that uncommon. I think in both my aircraft the FDR and CVR were not connected to the battery, or where only so with a retrofit.

Get it together, airlines!! 🤦🏻‍♂️","33: Hi everybody,\nThank you for your detailed explanation of this disaster—it was incredibly clear. I’m not an expert, but after watching the bird strike video, I noticed something that caught my attention. It appears that both engines were struck by birds. If you watch the video in slow motion, you can see faint smoke coming from engine #1 just before the larger plume of smoke emerges from engine #2.\nAdditionally, just moments before the plane disappears at the end of the video, you can see slight smoke coming from engine #1 again. Based on this, I believe engine #1 may have stalled immediately after the bird strike, preventing it from providing any further thrust. This might explain why there was no thrust from engine #1 when the plane landed.\nI wish I could attach pictures to this comment to highlight the moments where smoke is visible coming from engine #1 at two different points.","34: I always assumed the FDR &CVR either had their own power supply or were fed from the Hot Battery Bus, nothing else makes any sense at all!","35: Speaking as a clueless electrical engineer, one scenario that could explain things is a major electrical short circuit that mechanically or thermally connected both power systems as in making the dual system wire runs in one duct.","36: Did they lose the displays as well??","37: Maybe Boeing could upgrade these older planes without battery backup for the CVR by converting one of the cup holders to a cradle for a mobile phone set to record the conversation in the cockpit?","38: If true, then the plane wouldn't have the power to perform the 180 turn and a beautiful controlled gearless landing.  If runaway was longer, they likely would've survived.  All these power failure talk is just BS cover up for human error and to have insurance to pay for everything!","39: One would think they can fix the regulations so that all 737's must have backup power to the black boxes.  Such an old and outdated design.  Don't trust the plane anymore.  A flying rust bucket with ever bigger engines strapped on and no consideration of what a modern airliner needs to be.  Just sunset the design, set the existing planes to cargo only service like what happened with the failed DC-10 design, and get a real, modern passenger plane built for this role.  And please, put real engineers on the task with a \"work together\" mindset.  Stop this race to the bottom nonsense as it is just getting people killed and ends up costing more overall in the long run with all of the sheer incompetence that comes with it.  A plane has to be done right with the talent to do it right.  Screwing it up like what Boeing has been doing is so bad that it is just better to not build any planes.  Get out of the business if you don't want to lose your own shorts with your stupidity.  There is really no valid reason why we can't have a plane that can say take multiple bird strikes, have both engines go out, and still be perfectly flyable with basically everything still there, just without thrust, allowing the pilots every chance to get the plane safely on the ground and everything recorded somewhere while it happens.  We have the tech.  A modern plane design wouldn't have issue with this sort of scenario.  A rust bucket like the 737 in this scenario (not trying to say what happened in this case, just going for the more extreme scenario without blaming the pilots for shutting down the wrong engine as we haven't been told yet what all really happened) is going to have a lot of stuff shut off, helping to lead to a flight crew panicking and making more mistakes and maybe even unable to land the plane safely due to what all is not available.\n\nMaybe another thing to add is a plane's avionics should have an algorithm that detects both main engine generators are off in flight, check fuel status, check for volcanic ash, and if checks pass, automatically fire up the APU.  While we have good pilots like Sully who turned on his APU right away after a double bird strike, really, the plane should be smart enough to turn on the APU if the plane senses it is possible to turn it on while in flight after main generator failure.  Really, should automatically kick on after one generator failure so there is redundant power and hydraulics in the plane at any given time while in flight.  It should never be allowed to only have one generator on in flight if there is another one that is available.  And really, unless you have a really good battery system, which the 737 battery system obviously isn't that great, you shouldn't be allowed to fly without an operational APU.  Only a comprehensive battery system could allow for no operational APU.","40: Hello~ The video from Korea  mbc was suspicious,\nso I  left it as a video on my You Tube~ \nI hope Boeing is not harmed~ Please refer to it~","41: Correct me if I’m wrong, but the theory that the pilots shut down the left engine accidentally could be disproved if there is no conversation in the cockpit regarding shutting down an engine during the last seconds of the recording.  Surely shutting down an engine would have been discussed.  Thus pointing more toward multiple engine failure rather than pilot error?","42: They have things and national pride \n\nThus nothing surprising \n\n\nBlackbox should be indestructible and independent from external power source \n\n\nWith all the high tech advances in the last 10 years , it’s always human that’s the problem","43: After the bird strike the plane somehow suffered severe power issues, causing both cvr/fdr and ads-b to stop functioning","44: Question for 737 pilots: is it common knowledge as a pilot that CVRs and FDRs can be shut off by circuit breakers? Do you know which circuit breakers are connected?\nAre you aware that the NTSB has commented through safety forums that CVRs and FDRs must not be intentionally shut off?","45: Does the 737 not have an Essential power bus ? I can only find reference to a Transfer bus.","46: Thx Juan...","47: Would it be fair to say that out of this tragedy, a forthcoming FAA Service Bulletin for isolation of the FDR and/or VDR power source be retrofitted to those aircraft that have similar sole reliance upon the APU in circumstances similar to the accident aircraft?","48: Last four minutes of data missing?  How convenient.","49: It's obvious as we saw both engines were powered down. Electrically, with both engines off the Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) would've spun down down and disconnected electrically. The generator controller units would've open the generator breakers and with no other power source available, this would result in both transfer buses failing. \n\nWith one engine running, the other IDG could power both Transfer buses through the bus tie breakers to keep from losing any power from either side. \n\nThe transfer buses power another set of devices called Transformer Rectifier Units (TRU). XFR bus 1 powers TRU 1 and XFR bus 2 powers TRU 2 & 3. These TRUs power the respective DC Buses. TRU 1 = DC bus 1. TRU 2 = DC bus 2. TRU 3 = Battery bus normally. \n\n If XFR bus 1 fails, TRU 2 & 3 continues to power DC bus 1 through a dc tie bus relay. If XFR bus 2 fails, then TRU 1 & 3 power DC bus 2 through the same tie-bus relay and a TRU3 transfer relay. \n\nThis is how power is kept alive for those buses. \n\nThe static inverter (powered by the batteries) only power the AC Stby bus when AC XFR 1 loses power. The DC standby, battery bus, hot and switched hot battery bus are powered by the batteries directly when AC power is not available. \n\nThere are also manual controls to these such as the Transfer Bus switch or the Standby Power switch up in flight deck, which would prevent closing the tie breakers and relays, but it's doubtful they even touched those. \n\nDon't know why Boeing did not choose another power source for the FDR and CVR. Just stating how the aircraft is designed as is.","50: An average passenger probably expect the whole air plane system to be designed in redundancy if not triple.  This proves that is not the case.  And the air plane probably lost the power completely and the cockpit's digital instrument went black.  I read some \"i'm better than you\" expert saying why not activate APU.  You do that in that situation and you are much better pilot than 99.9% of them.  It ain't exactly like you flip on the APU as you like.  And you gonna ignite the APU with your flint rock?  Boeing, you are spared of your death sentence this time but as there are so many of this air planes are out there, the truth of your design prowess will come out soon or later.  Sadly that will cost human lives.","51: Do they keep you from lowering the landing gears?","52: Why don’t both the CVR and FDR units contain their own batteries as backups? In case of AC failure, they can automatically switch to DC.","53: My house has apc battery backups on all electronics. When the power goes out, i can keep on gaming without internet issues. The generator turns on automatically, and the batteries are only needed for about 15 seconds. \nBoeing airplanes: everything is connected to the one thing that will fail in an emergency","54: This aircraft was designed in the 90's and manufactured in 2012, it's up to the owner (or the operator) to upgrade their equipment or modernize it in the 2020's only if approved by the FAA (or in this case the Korean Aviation Office \"KOCA\"). I bet there are thousands of similar airplanes that are still operating without a recorder backup power source.","55: Still no atc tapes released (only a transcript) , still no pilot names released.  Very strange.","56: I think what happened was similar to the Kegworth air disaster with British Midland Airways Flight 092, the Pilot shut down the wrong engine.","57: I smell an AD in the future re-wiring that system lots of avionics guys getting lots of overtime.","58: Well that's a bummer, yet another Boeing design flaw.","59: Ram Air Turbine? If not why not?","60: I fail to understand why the CVR/FDR aren’t on the switched hot battery bus. Seems like a pretty simple fix to me, especially since they can’t take that much power.","61: My question is why it took a few weeks to determine that the last 4 minutes of data is missing?","62: Koreans deleted the last 4 minutes. Its too embarrassing what they found out.","63: The first thing Sully Sullenberger did 2 seconds into the crisis was activate the APU (Auxillary Power Unit). Later determined to be decisive. Most famous bird strike. Do they teach this?","64: I bet the battery has a fuse, the bird strike must've caused an electrical power surge, I bet the fuse blew out. That would cause no power in and no power out of the battery. Powerful batteries need smart battery protection systems, transistors, not fuses/breakers.","65: It makes zero sense that these devices are not connected to any backup power sources","66: I can’t stop thinking that the pilots pulled the breakers after making the error of killing the good engine.","67: Tell us, Juan, what do the CVR and the FDR have to do with flying the airplane?","68: Given how almost everything is sham and fraud here in Korea, I see it no different this time. \nThey don't use their brain on the right thing, but on the wrong thing,","69: Just had a near miss here in SYDNEY a Qantas 737 on final with a Qantas A380 on threshold 🔥☠️🔥very close 737 went around but prob only 30secs in it alt was 400ft 🔥☠️🔥whats going on lately with aviation 🤷‍♂️🙆‍♂️😩","70: Those poor souls had almost no chance.  Sounds like both engines failed from bird strike.  \nAltitude data shows they had already started climbing before bird strike, so couldn't land straight ahead on runway 1.  \nPilots did one hell of a job and did everything right per training.  \nOnly thing they could have done different was push nose down after touchdown to slow down faster, and kick the rudder at end of runway to try and miss ILS embankment.  \nBut nobody trains for that.   \nI can only guess they kept nose up in an attempt to \"porpoise\" over embankment.  \nNo good options.  May everyone rest in peace.","71: Would the pilots be so bold as to turn off the CDR and CVR after they accidentally shut down the wrong engine ? To protect themselves and their families ? …from embarrassment ?","72: What if they fire handled the left engine. \nDoes that get recorded before it cuts the current or not......?","73: Given the importance of the CVR and the FDR, you would expect that the electrical backup system would be robust, but in some aircraft, evidently not. The loss of that data will be a hindrance to solving the mysteries surrounding this accident.","74: I smell cover up.","75: I trained on the Boeing 737-300/500 thirty years ago and I remember the specific training scenario of a low altitude dual engine failure where the oral question was, \"What do you have available electrically, and what do you not have?\" I definitely recall \"We can start the APU, and other than that, neither the DFDR or CVR was powered. The conclusion back then? \"Yep, until you get either the APU started, up-to-speed and its generator powering the bus, the FAA and the NTSB won't have a clue how you screwed it up.\" This came from the TASA B737 dual engine failure where they made a successful forced landing on the dike in Louisiana (IIRC): we spent a lot of time figuring out how that system worked.\n\nQuestion: How long does in an inflight start of the 737-800's APU from toggling the APU to START to the point where the APU generator picks up the busses, take? On the older 737-300, I seem to recall it was about one minute (but someone more current than I am will have a better recollection).\n\nYou know another way we can tell whether the jet experienced a dual engine failure/shutdown/whatever? Let's LOOK AT THE RECOVERED ENGINES from the wreck. Let's also try to go through the cockpit wreckage and see where the Start Levers are. But I wouldn't put too much stock in Start Lever position: anyone who screwed up and shut down the engine would have IMMEDIATELY returned the Start Lever to the Run position! (Human nature.) But we can check the CFM56 internal positions of the Variable Stator Vanes: are they in Start or Run? If in Start, then the Start Switches were cycled OFF-RUN and you have evidence of an intentional, if erroneous, shut down.","76: Hey 737 experts out there, on this 737NG, does the FDR record the Engine Fuel Cutoff Level position? If yes, this would have been recorded on the FDR as the good engine generator would still be powering the FDR. Not sure as standards vary by generation of 737 aircraft.","77: After the horrible bird and electrical degradation event/s, with getting the airplane  under control a priority, either pilot immediately reach up and start the APU. I FLEW .767 and 757 18,000 hours.","78: We don't know the conversation in the cockpit leading up to the electrics not working.  They haven't release anything yet.  However, I am sure the if there was a discussion among the two pilots to turn off the engine, we will know at least up to that point in time.","79: Wow! What an ommision. A bad design flaw not having power to the recorders no matter what is happening.","80: Through examination of the wreckage, if possible, it would be interesting to see the mechanical position of the engine fire handles and start levers.","81: The new data suggests the Black Box stopped recording 4 minutes before the crash. If the plane engines were turned off then... is it possible for the plane to do their go around just 1 minute after that? Without any engine power?","82: Only Boeing could come up with an electrical system that didn't have battery backup for the CVR and FDR.","83: Bad news...","84: If the recorder shows when which engine was shutdown  and when ,that should exist that might be a good place to start","85: Nothing seems to add up whatsoever! My only explanation is that they shut down the wrong engine, similar to the british midland B737 incident at east midlands airport back in i believe 1989, basically with the jeju incident they panicked, shut the wrong engine down, due to been low in height and speed they didnt lower landing gear or set flaps which resulted in an extremely long float and belly landing, then game over!!","86: I had to re-due a part of a check ride  one time because I (as the flying pilot and captain) hit the APU start buttons out of sequence from the check list.  I know check lists are important, however there is also systems knowledge (or should be) in all pilots heads.  Keeping electric power on these airplanes keeps a cascade effect to a minimum.  I think Sully did something similar.","87: I knew there was something fishy about this crash ad soon as i saw it and now they just happened to lose the last 4 mins of the recordings... Yea im not buying it 🤔","88: It's \"jehjoo\" not \"Jay Jew\" please thanks","89: If it was complete electrical failure how was one engine producing thrust ??","90: Q:  Can pilots manually shut off these recorders?","91: Just another nail in the 737's coffin as far as i'm concerned. This plane is a design from the 1960s.Come on get rid of it already boeing.","92: Impact was at 09:03am Local, if last 4 minutes was lost on CVR/FDR, that means it was lost at 08:59am, but crew were still talking to ATC at 09:01am without mentioning electrical failure. How could they talk with tower during an electrical failure?","93: the plot thickens","94: that plane slammed the runway under no control at the stick","95: In raw video as you pointed out Juan, an engine was heard spooling down after impact. 2216 Could be heard under power as it skated across the runway. With thrust Reverse doors open  The right engine had to be at idle.  so there was still electrical power. The odds against such a confluence of problems (not communicated -incidentally) are so remote pilot had to have disabled power. Disconnecting transfer bus only requires pressing one button.  This pilot who was sleep deprived had issues.","96: If a simple, \"bird strike\" can disable electric motors that power flap extension and other vital components then the answer is simple. You don't fly on a Boeing 737-800  or allow your family to ever  fly on a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. That is a serious design flaw.","97: Something seems to be very wrong with this whole incident, I'm suspicious that something was going on that was being hidden, or someone tried to hide it post crash?","98: Unbelievable! Those Boeing engineers really suck!! How can an emergency system not work in an emergency? How can recorders rely on dubious power sources?","99: Still i would say not electrical issues or pilot mistake killed them but horrible runway design with that purring concrete there"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6785877a39cb9e88a0f0074d"},"video_id":"SZuvIaKmIA4","title":"Jeju Air Flight Crash: Black Boxes Stopped Recording Data Four Minutes Before the Tragic Accident","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZuvIaKmIA4","text":"Vavan continues to be with us for more on this story. Adya: This is a breakthrough now, or rather this is now a setback for authorities who thought there was a breakthrough when the black boxes were recovered but now key data is missing. Well, exactly this shows the callousness of Ju-Air in this. You know, as you rightly mentioned, out, that the flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been missing from the black boxes, which point to a major error in this entire investigation. You are right; the South Korean Transport Ministry has just declared this. And let us remind our viewers that the American investigators had also joined this investigation post-crash of Ju-Airflight at Manan International Airport. They had hoped to get something from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders but unfortunately, this has turned out to be a very serious issue. As we know, when the flight was about to land, the landing gear was not deployed properly, which led to a major incident mishap. So, this is a very significant issue because since the data is not available, since you have the record of the flight data and voice recorder, it raises questions about the investigation's transparency and thoroughness. This situation also highlights the importance of having comprehensive and accessible data in aviation investigations. Adya: This is all for now.

For more information, I'd like to welcome Steven Wright, head of aviation and transport at the Technological University of Dublin. Steven R I wants to be clear that we don't know anything conclusive yet, but some officials suspect the crash could have been caused by a bird strike. Could you explain to our viewers how small birds can bring down big planes? PLS good evening. The problem with birds is that they can be ingested. This is a seaside airport, so it stretches out towards the sea and means there are problems with wildlife, such as birds. Now this was given as a warning to the flight crew from what we understand from the transcripts recorded by Air Traffic Control on the ground. Birds get ingested typically just into one engine, causing catastrophic damage to that engine itself. Although you lose thrust, you also lose other services, namely hydraulics, electrics, and pneumatic air. This is a particular problem. How often do bird strikes happen? And shouldn't there be security measures in place to at least minimize bird flocks at airports? There are simple answers: yes, they can happen occasionally. The airport does mitigate the problem by having ground services that scare away birds; they prevent them from nesting in trees and use other countermeasures to keep birds away. So it just happens sometimes. Tell us why in your opinion the airplane did not have its landing gear lowered. I can't give you a definitive answer, but looking at the video, there are some things that don't quite sit well with me: namely, it's apparent that the flight controls and hydraulic systems on the flight controls were hydraulically assisted; they weren't extended so things like the spoilers and the landing gear, although normally extended and retracted using hydraulic services, have an emergency freeold. You can pull a handle in the floor on the aircraft to unlock all the landing gear, making it naturally open up, and then the pilot performs a few maneuvers left and right to force the landing gear down.","comments":["0: No way they are going to publicize the truth","1: The answer is the oldest, most lame, most popular one on earth:   THEY FORGOT.   They tried desperately to get airborne again but with the engines dragging on the pavement forcing the opening of the reverse thrust apparatus, becoming airborne was impossible.   The bird strike served only to be a dangerous distraction causing them to panic making them believe they suddenly needed to get on the ground as soon as possible and as a result they simply forgot to do the most basic of tasks having done it once already just a few moments ago,  to again release the landing gear.","2: How about they did not know about the manual gear release handles under a access panel just to the right of the pilots seat Raise the panel and pull a handle , one for each set of wheels . I still say they did not know what to do .","3: Wrong answer! Because \nPilot didn’t change there mind; it was the control center operator that tell them to get back and land the wrong way 😭","4: It's the same as reported: bird strike, failed landing gear, and there were only about 20 seconds before the plane crashed, a fireball.","5: Stop terrors in US and S.

Have seen many smaller bird strikes just smears on the fuselage or a nicked fan blade Puff of smoke out of that engine indicates to me it was pretty good size bird..","17: I could give you the same answer cause he said I don’t know","18: The problem with that particular Jeju 737 800 started on route to china and it was engine related as far as i know. It seems to be related to the shortage of spare parts for engines on the market. I doubt they repaired the engine in 2 days, it is impossible as it is not a normal standard repair, so we have good probability this flight which ended in the wall with 178 fatalities flew with one failing engine in questionable shape and the other engine was possibly destroyed in the birdstrike. It is consistent with video footage, with one engine backfiring and pumping because of compressor stall (right engine) and the other engine completely out (left engine). In such situation Boeing has not any backup for many hydraulic systems including flaps and spoilers, hence the  high landing speed without flaps. As there was only one damaged engine available and it was destroyed completely after the touchdown, there was not thrust reverse so the doomed aircraft overshot the runway and ended in the concrete wall. It doesn't sound as a pilot mistake at all. It sounds as a problem with airplane design, airport design and maintenance and spare parts availability on the market and supply chain. And it looks like maintenance crew greenlighted faulty engine in the air.","19: in the old days, american made actually means something but now is just full of lies and money in the CEO pocket.","20: Did the pilot dump fuel before emergency landing?\n\nThe runwaway design seems dangerous","21: Why can't some kind of steel screen type of covers over the engines be used to keep the birds from passing through the engines themselves....???

Loss of an engine is no problem unless the good engine is shut down in error. If this was the case, there would be no time for the pilots to do much of anything but get on the ground ASAP although a restart of one engine may have been attempted. The concrete support structure for the ILS antennas may have been there to protect occupied buildings in the path of the overrun  should the outer concrete wall have been breached. Many questions still need to be answered.","29: There seems to be two distinct camps here. One says WALL! The other says DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I'm in the second camp.","30: Failure to read the Checklist. Why abandon a stabilized approach for an unnecessary  go around? Cell phone footage shows wheels and flaps were down at moment of birdstrike.  Why raise flaps and gear then make a second approach without gear down? ANSWER failure to perform checklist.[Update 9 January] These Jeju pilots had a flyable aircraft and made a deliberate wheels up landing. This crash needs a psychologist to solve it. The pilot flying likely the 6,500hr captain made really crazy decisions. I doubt he ever communicated with his 1,600hr co-pilot.","31: You can't blame a bird strike for the crew landing with the wheels up!  Preliminary indications are that a routine, survivable emergency procedure was botched.","32: Based on the video i saw clearly, i don’t think it’s about birds striking, I clearly saw the Landing gear tires didn’t come out and the plane landed with it belly that caused the crash and additional the concrete walls was so close .

Let's assume there was no pilot error. Why would he come in with flaps up and gear up? If he lost all power he would keep the flaps up and gear up to glide further. He landed long. He misjudged the glide rate by about 2 to 3 seconds. He had no power so he couldn't go around. He landed with perfect control on the runway it was just long. This is what would happen with no power. No reverse thrusters and no brakes to slow down. This is the only thing that makes sense unless there was really bad pilot error.","36: 1. plane about to land, 700 feet left \n2. bird strike.\n3.

The plane did 13 flights that day and one of the pilots were either sleeping in the cockpit or not in the cockpit at all. \nThe situation was too much for one pilot to handle forgetting to lower the gear and not being able to land at the beginning of the runway. \n\nOr\n\n\nthe birds struck the engine but ALSO STRUCK the windshield pearcing it and hitting both pilots and blood and gore over the controls. The co pilot was unconscious and the captain also injured struggled to handle the plane by himself and simply forgot or did not have the time to release the gear while also making a tight turn. Injured and  with controls covered with gore he did not have time to release the gear and also caused him to land in the middle of the runway","76: december 2024 is not koreas month thats for sure","77: Why dafuq is there a concrete wall at the end of the runway...... Wtf did they think would happen when a plane hits it","78: There are several clues here, and here is what I think happened. \n1). Birdstrike in engine 2 caused a flameout during the approach, and they decided to go around and start the birdstrike procedures. \n2.) Unfortunately, right after this decision they made a crucial mistake and shut down ENG 1, the wrong one. \n3.) They called mayday, and realized they had lost power and hydraulics, as a dual engine failure would render the hydraulic pumps needed for the landing configuration useless. \n4.) They now had to start the APU, a small engine in the back of the plane that can power the essentials, but this is a lengthy process. \n5) They overshot the runway due to ground the ground effect, and since their plane lost both engines, a landing configuration was impossible at this time. \n\nEvidence that points to this case:\n- Other video that has surfaced shows the engine hit by the bird at least partly functioning, as thrust reversers deploy and a mirage is visible from the heat of the exhaust. The lack of this mirage and the absence of the reverse thruster in eng 2 supports the idea that the healthy engine was not on. \n- The starting of the APU is supported by the fact that an engine spool-down sound is heard immediately after the crash, where the only engine that would still be intact would be that APU in the tail of the plane. \n\nJust my speculation.","79: I can tell you what caused it: Boeing cutting costs. As usual. \nWe know all companies do it, why are we allowing it?","80: We really don't respect the daring things we do sometimes. I bet everyone reading this has flown on an plane. They've been 10.000m flying in the sky and that's just mundane now but it's anything but. It's incredible but we don't respect things like that anymore and become careless","81: It’s not 100% clear what exactly went wrong , for what the landing gear was not down and were the pilot lost the awareness about the landing gear otherwise for such a landing at that speed and to touchdown very late almost halfway the runway it’s very sad on the part of pilots I guess. I am sure they tried their best but somewhat I feel they surely did panicked and the wall made it the worst possible disaster. Coz pilots at least landed the airplane down safely, since they didn’t  have any brakes and had to wait till the skid is over but unfortunately it just continued and hit the most aweful object exactly at the end of the runway. One thing pilot surely could have done better in touchdown a little early so the chances of hard impact would have been less or might have stopped before that. So so sad for the lost souls of the passengers and the crew 😢","82: Wow! What a mess!","83: So many experts in the comment section","84: so Sad, may all souls in peace!","85: Foam carpet ?","86: // EMPTY PLANE //","87: Another possible theory. One of the engines stopped operating after the bird strike, so with just one other engine working, the pilot had to fly at a faster speed just to stay in the air and keep that big heavy plane from falling out of the sky. Modern jet airliners have a feature that when flying above a certain speed, the Hydraulics used to lower the landing gear are automatically turned off so that the landing gear cannot be lowered during mid flight at high speeds. So, when that plane landed it was having to fly so fast with only one engine to keep from dropping too steeply from the air that the hydraulics were still disabled preventing the landing gear from being lowered. If the pilot had tried to slow the speed with only one engine flying that heavy of a plane in order to try and lower the landing gear, it would have dropped way too fast to even get the gear down in time before it touched down on the runway. In which case they had to resort to trying to belly land at a higher landing speed than normal in order to maintain a gradual descent.","88: My condolences to the bereaved families, rest in peace to the 179 passengers who lost their lives.","89: Reverse thrust is to assist landing gear brakes.

Why didn't fire tenders lay a foam carpet on the runway when it was clear? The plane was attempting an emergency landing without its landing gear extended. I would say in response to that, you can't simply give a few thousand liters of foam and solve the problem. Runways are typically two to three kilometers long, so you'd need a lot more than that. Another big problem is this aircraft intended to come straight in from the sea but then changed its mind, turning around and returning in the opposite direction. The video shows the plane coming off the tarmac and hitting a wall. Now what you probably haven't been explained is that this airport like so many in Korea are shared by both civil business and also military. So the Civil side of this effectively is a protected area, and I've traveled to South Korea many times in Marito Korean, so I've seen many airfields where they have brick walls with razor wire on top of the walls to keep unwanted visitors out. They didn't hit from what I've seen; it's not like 25 miles of black asphalt and simply you know you can chuck a few thousand liters of foam and problem solved. Runways tend to be two to three kilometers long, so you can give you an idea how much foam would be required for that purpose. The next big problem is this aircraft intended to come straight in from the sea but then changed its mind, turning around and returning back in the opposite direction. You mentioned the fact that runways are long; now what they've done is hit a concrete structure that supports the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer at the end of the runway and it's plowed through that and at high speed, that then shredded the aircraft.","comments":["0: No way they are going to publicize the truth","1: The answer is the oldest, most lame, most popular one on earth:   THEY FORGOT.   They tried desperately to get airborne again but with the engines dragging on the pavement forcing the opening of the reverse thrust apparatus, becoming airborne was impossible.   The bird strike served only to be a dangerous distraction causing them to panic making them believe they suddenly needed to get on the ground as soon as possible and as a result they simply forgot to do the most basic of tasks having done it once already just a few moments ago,  to again release the landing gear.","2: How about they did not know about the manual gear release handles under a access panel just to the right of the pilots seat Raise the panel and pull a handle , one for each set of wheels .

It seems to be related to the shortage of spare parts for engines on the market. I doubt they repaired the engine in 2 days, it is impossible as it is not a normal standard repair, so we have good probability this flight which ended in the wall with 178 fatalities flew with one failing engine in questionable shape and the other engine was possibly destroyed in the birdstrike. It is consistent with video footage, with one engine backfiring and pumping because of compressor stall (right engine) and the other engine completely out (left engine). In such situation Boeing has not any backup for many hydraulic systems including flaps and spoilers, hence the  high landing speed without flaps. As there was only one damaged engine available and it was destroyed completely after the touchdown, there was not thrust reverse so the doomed aircraft overshot the runway and ended in the concrete wall. It doesn't sound as a pilot mistake at all. It sounds as a problem with airplane design, airport design and maintenance and spare parts availability on the market and supply chain. And it looks like maintenance crew greenlighted faulty engine in the air.","19: in the old days, american made actually means something but now is just full of lies and money in the CEO pocket.","20: Did the pilot dump fuel before emergency landing?\n\nThe runwaway design seems dangerous","21: Why can't some kind of steel screen type of covers over the engines be used to keep the birds from passing through the engines themselves....???

Loss of an engine is no problem unless the good engine is shut down in error. If this was the case, there would be no time for the pilots to do much of anything but get on the ground ASAP although a restart of one engine may have been attempted. The concrete support structure for the ILS antennas may have been there to protect occupied buildings in the path of the overrun  should the outer concrete wall have been breached. Many questions still need to be answered.","29: There seems to be two distinct camps here. One says WALL! The other says DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I'm in the second camp.","30: Failure to read the Checklist. Why abandon a stabilized approach for an unnecessary  go around? Cell phone footage shows wheels and flaps were down at moment of birdstrike.  Why raise flaps and gear then make a second approach without gear down? ANSWER failure to perform checklist.[Update 9 January] These Jeju pilots had a flyable aircraft and made a deliberate wheels up landing. This crash needs a psychologist to solve it. The pilot flying likely the 6,500hr captain made really crazy decisions. I doubt he ever communicated with his 1,600hr co-pilot.","31: You can't blame a bird strike for the crew landing with the wheels up!  Preliminary indications are that a routine, survivable emergency procedure was botched.","32: Based on the video i saw clearly, i don’t think it’s about birds striking, I clearly saw the Landing gear tires didn’t come out and the plane landed with it belly that caused the crash and additional the concrete walls was so close .

You can't even determine if it's attempting a landing or a go around because they chose both lol","34: Firstly, tere are atleast three hydraulics ways the landing gear could be lowered...and electric one too...bird hit for failure of multiple hydraulic systems is not understood\nSecondly, why was the fuel not emptied befo re e the landing...basic","35: Everyone is missing the obvious.... Let's assume there was no pilot error. Why would he come in with flaps up and gear up? If he lost all power he would keep the flaps up and gear up to glide further. He landed long. He misjudged the glide rate by about 2 to 3 seconds. He had no power so he couldn't go around. He landed with perfect control on the runway it was just long. This is what would happen with no power. No reverse thrusters and no brakes to slow down. This is the only thing that makes sense unless there was really bad pilot error.","36: 1. plane about to land, 700 feet left \n2. bird strike.\n3.

The plane did 13 flights that day and one of the pilots were either sleeping in the cockpit or not in the cockpit at all. \nThe situation was too much for one pilot to handle forgetting to lower the gear and not being able to land at the beginning of the runway. \n\nOr\n\n\nthe birds struck the engine but ALSO STRUCK the windshield pearcing it and hitting both pilots and blood and gore over the controls. The co pilot was unconscious and the captain also injured struggled to handle the plane by himself and simply forgot or did not have the time to release the gear while also making a tight turn. Injured and  with controls covered with gore he did not have time to release the gear and also caused him to land in the middle of the runway","76: december 2024 is not koreas month thats for sure","77: Why dafuq is there a concrete wall at the end of the runway...... Wtf did they think would happen when a plane hits it","78: There are several clues here, and here is what I think happened. \n1). Birdstrike in engine 2 caused a flameout during the approach, and they decided to go around and start the birdstrike procedures. \n2.) Unfortunately, right after this decision they made a crucial mistake and shut down ENG 1, the wrong one. \n3.) They called mayday, and realized they had lost power and hydraulics, as a dual engine failure would render the hydraulic pumps needed for the landing configuration useless. \n4.) They now had to start the APU, a small engine in the back of the plane that can power the essentials, but this is a lengthy process. \n5) They overshot the runway due to ground the ground effect, and since their plane lost both engines, a landing configuration was impossible at this time. \n\nEvidence that points to this case:\n- Other video that has surfaced shows the engine hit by the bird at least partly functioning, as thrust reversers deploy and a mirage is visible from the heat of the exhaust. The lack of this mirage and the absence of the reverse thruster in eng 2 supports the idea that the healthy engine was not on. \n- The starting of the APU is supported by the fact that an engine spool-down sound is heard immediately after the crash, where the only engine that would still be intact would be that APU in the tail of the plane. \n\nJust my speculation.","79: I can tell you what caused it: Boeing cutting costs. As usual. \nWe know all companies do it, why are we allowing it?","80: We really don't respect the daring things we do sometimes. I bet everyone reading this has flown on an plane. They've been 10.000m flying in the sky and that's just mundane now but it's anything but. It's incredible but we don't respect things like that anymore and become careless","81: It’s not 100% clear what exactly went wrong , for what the landing gear was not down and were the pilot lost the awareness about the landing gear otherwise for such a landing at that speed and to touchdown very late almost halfway the runway it’s very sad on the part of pilots I guess. I am sure they tried their best but somewhat I feel they surely did panicked and the wall made it the worst possible disaster. Coz pilots at least landed the airplane down safely, since they didn’t  have any brakes and had to wait till the skid is over but unfortunately it just continued and hit the most aweful object exactly at the end of the runway. One thing pilot surely could have done better in touchdown a little early so the chances of hard impact would have been less or might have stopped before that. So so sad for the lost souls of the passengers and the crew 😢","82: Wow! What a mess!","83: So many experts in the comment section","84: so Sad, may all souls in peace!","85: Foam carpet ?","86: // EMPTY PLANE //","87: Another possible theory. One of the engines stopped operating after the bird strike, so with just one other engine working, the pilot had to fly at a faster speed just to stay in the air and keep that big heavy plane from falling out of the sky.

This tragedy took the lives of 179 people and raised critical questions about aviation safety, birth strikes, and emergency protocols. We will take you through the series of events leading to the crash, examine the actions taken by the flight crew, the rescue efforts, and the ongoing investigation. Stay with us as we uncover the heartbreaking story of Flight 2216 and its profound impact on aviation worldwide. JUJu Air was founded in 2005 and has long been one of South Korea's most successful low-cost carriers, operating a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft on domestic and international routes. The airline's reputation for safety and efficiency earned it a loyal customer base. Flight 2216, which tragically crashed, was no exception to this history of reliable service. On December 29th, 2024, JUJu Air flight 2216 was in route from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, to Muan International Airport in South Korea. The flight carried 175 passengers and six crew members, most of whom were returning home after vacations or business trips. The Boeing 737-800, which had been in service for nearly 19 years and was well maintained, took off from Suvarnabhumi Airport around 2:28 PM local time. Everything appeared to be going according to plan during the initial stages of the flight. However, a routine incident turned into a disaster when the aircraft encountered a bird strike that damaged its landing gear. The failure of the landing gear made it impossible for the plane to land safely on the runway at Muan International Airport. As the aircraft touched down, it skidded uncontrollably, creating sparks and flames from the friction between the fuselage and the runway embankment. The impact caused a violent explosion, tearing the plane apart within moments. The aircraft was engulfed in fire, leaving little chance for passengers to escape. In total, 177 people perished in the crash, with only two survivors: a flight attendant and a passenger who sustained severe injuries. Rescue efforts were heroic but unfortunately, survival was unlikely for most of the passengers.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d102f6"},"video_id":"nt2wgj-nU6Q","title":"The Jeju Air Flight 2216 Tragedy | Aviation&#39;s Deadliest Disaster in Recent History","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt2wgj-nU6Q","text":"Rescue operations began immediately following the crash. Onean International Airport Emergency Response Team, along with local fire brigades and paramedics, rushed into the scene to locate survivors amidst the wreckage. The dense smoke and flames posed a significant challenge, but rescue teams worked tirelessly to retrieve those who could be saved. Given the nature of the crash, only two people survived: a flight attendant and a passenger. The aftermath was devastating for both the families of the victims and the aviation community. The loss of 179 lives, including many innocent passengers, is a sobering moment for the industry. Investigations are ongoing to understand the cause of the bird strike, the failure of the landing gear, and airport safety protocols. Initial findings suggest that the bird strike was a major factor in the crash. While bird strikes are common, they generally do not result in fatalities. However, in this case, the damage to the aircraft's landing gear made it impossible for the plane to land safely. The investigation also brought to light issues with airport wildlife management practices. Muan International Airport had measures in place to deter birds, but experts suggest that more robust strategies are necessary to reduce the risk of bird strikes in the future. The crash of JUJu AirFly 2216 serves as a tragic reminder of how quickly a routine flight can turn into a disaster. The loss of 179 lives is a sobering moment for the aviation industry, and we hope that changes will be made to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims, and we will continue to follow the story as investigations unfold.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d102f7"},"video_id":"igdTYvxFvSs","title":"Did Flight Crew&#39;s Panic Cause the Jeju Air Flight 2216 Disaster? | Analysis of Boeing 737-800 Crash","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdTYvxFvSs","text":"The investigation into this crash will likely uncover recommendations aimed at enhancing airline safety, focusing on procedural improvements for handling emergencies and possibly addressing crew training or stress management techniques. However, it is important to recognize that even if these measures are implemented, the human factor remains a significant challenge in aviation safety.

This should be visited in Aviation industry. \nAnother point, when shutting down one engine accidentally, it should provide feedback to the pilot quicky then he can reinitiate restart engine, and it must be a fast activation.

May their Souls RIP","17: Putting the wall at the end of the runway was extremely and rediculously \nfoolish. 🙏😔","18: The bird strike could have caused the number 2 engine to explode directly damaging the yellow hydraulic system or the shrapnel could have severed any number of under belly wires. Both of these have happened before and they both can cause major failure of important systems.","19: How sad frightening for them \nCould be bird's strike's","20: I think personally you are stretching the margins of your remit here. There are flight recorders and an international air investigation going on. Too much speculation as is the way with instant social media.","21: How about the possibility that the aircraft had still too much speed? And so, it was impossible to get the landing gear out (like the Pakistani airline 8303 which crashed between the houses)...","22: It is all fine and dandy but same type of plane belly landed in Oslo on same week... That is very suspects...","23: @Dr. Todd Grande you know there are reaction videos , your videos are none reaction videos, what videos are you making exactly like really , what is the point of your videos but seeing your todd face? \nConclusion? Education? I don't understand why you are making videos\n\nyou can not even stick to your topics , you're just following trends.","24: I'm an aviation geek (non pilot)... This is, on the fare of it..a fantastic set of assumptions. Dr Grande you are \"flying high' in this episode","25: All i know is smoke in any situation puts your brain in fight or flight mode. If the pilots smelled, saw or even got a wiff of fire almost all training would become second to what our brains are trained through evolution to do, which is get out immediately..","26: Insightful and certainly got me thinking. That is great analysis and journalism Dr.","27: There is a great discussion @Pilot Debrief titled \"what no one is saying about\" this disaster. The graphics are excellent.","28: Your third opinion is most likely correct but this panic situation will never be officially admitted.","29: The flight attendants in the back are only a few feet from the last row of passengers... That few feet is the toilets... The only survivors of this crash were saved by the toilets...","30: I do not like the new automatic play feature. I can't be alone there.","31: Botched up landing that did not have to happen.","32: Likely cause is pilot fatigue. Led to bad decisions.","33: They could have done a turn around to land on water as last ditch recourse.","34: this might be a dumb question… why they don’t put like steel net infront of the engine so if bird does strike it get caught up and not go into the engine","35: The wall of death","36: Thank you for reminding us of airline safety statistics! I'm about to go on a long flight and was petrified, so this is so reassuring. ❤","37: 10:30 but there are far more cars out there than there are planes so there are far more injuries from auto accidents reported","38: I see many comments reaching to a hasty conclusion that the pilots' panicking mainly caused the crash.\nRemember, innocent until proven. Furthermore, there were multiple cases of the airline employees exposing the poor state of the safety checking procedures of their company months or even years before this incident. It is now also estimated that for whatever reason(could be birds, or could be poor repairment), both engines of the plane broke down minutes before the crash. Because of this factor, the plane could just drop dead straight from the sky but(as you can see from the footage) it landed without exploding. All the passengers could've survived if it wasn't for that goddam wall. So it could be the case that both pilots stood calm and tried their best to save those 180 people.\nI'm not a family member or whatsoever of the pilots, I'm just sad that they are getting blamed for the crash(without enough evidence!) after meeting their demise in such a horrible way.","39: One thing I’d like to comment on was, the engine that was supposedly inop due to the bird strike was in fact producing some thrust and you can see it when it came in to land. Losing all hydraulics is possible only if they have lost both engines: 1) they could have mistakenly shut down engine no. 1.  At this point, they would not have time to go over any checklists and just came in to land without gears nor flaps. 2. Seeing that they had some control over the aircraft when tear dropping and coming into belly land, I could have sworn at least one of the engines was producing some thrust, in fact it was engine no. 2 (the one that suffered a bird strike and subsequently a compressor stall), and if thats the case it doesn’t explain why they didn’t have the gear down because the hydraulics would have been working. So was it because they were so rushed and had no time to just extend the gears? 3. As a pilot on the final I would have carried on to land the bird with flaps 15 if I had only one engine working but then again I wasn’t presented with the parameters they were presented witn the stress they had in a limited amount of time.","40: I used to be a 777 pilot, now I’m rated on the A320 in Europe. Just wanted to appreciate your knowledge in aviation, dr grande. For someone who’s profession and field of study is psychology, I felt like I was listening to a fellow pilot analyze and talk about the crash while watching your video. Kudos to you and there are so many armchair pilots who put out as much as videos as possible on the crash but yours even though you do not claim to be someone you are not is very well organized and informative. Thanks dr grande!","41: Sorry Dr Grande , you are factually incorrect @13.15 you say that no power is necessary for flap deployment. Wheras this is true for the landing gear (after uplocks are released from the flight deck) , for flaps then electric power is necessary for alternate flap deployment-which is quite a slow process.","42: Empty fuel","43: 2:58…milliseconds before this plume of smoke exits the right engine, a tiny plume exits the left one. You cannot see this in your video footage, but in this particular viral video. It’s worth looking into, as nobody has mentioned it anywhere.","44: Panic case mate","45: Even if that burm wasn't there the plane was traveling so fast it would have smashed into the outer airport security wall and the outcome would of been exactly the same. Let's stop talking about the ils antenna wall and really investigate and get into what the hell the pilots were doing and thinking and saying. This is clearly pilot error in the fact that they obviously handled the single engine bird strike issue poorly. Once the cockpit voice recorder data is extracted we will know exactly what happened.","46: All this talk about what these pilots shouldn`t have done and all that they should have done. If the antennae at the end of the runway had been frangible, they wouldn`t have died. Even if your plane is punctured by anti-aircraft flak as was the case with the Azerbeijani plane, many on board can still survive even if you don`t land on a runway. But this can only happen when you don`t hit an anti tank grade barrier seconds after crash landing","47: also the pilots were flying since 2 am,  when the birdstrike occured at 9 am they werent in there best mental condition to make the correct decisions. The whole incident whether we like it or not is due to pilot error, the concrete wall complicated all the errors and made it fatal for everyone. Without the wall, this would have been another gear up landing (with no injuries) which is fairly common in the industry, with 2 occuring in the same week.","48: The wheels didnt come down,its a hydraulic problem, which is a system powered by the engines","49: You should talk about the Russian-Azerbaijani flight that crash in Kazakhstan due to an anti-drone system","50: “Captain Sum Ting Wong,” “Wi Tu Lo,” “Ho Lee Fuk” and “Bang Ding Ow.","51: Your calculations are incorrect. How many people travel in cars are on the road vs airplane. You might fly once or twice a year on average. But in the car everyday. Your statistics are flawed.","52: The pilot ask the steward which engine is off 😮😮 the steward says the one on the right. Captain says which one? The stew heard says yes .","53: 💕 Very well said ✅","54: I was on the same flight type of plane and same airline but I’m so lucky I wasn’t on a plane that day","55: It is no comfort to anyone to hear that flying on a plane is safer than traveling in a car.","56: @1:28 Covid 19 didn't disrupt operations, our (over) reaction to the head cold did. \nReason for the crash? Was it a DEI hire panic? \nFor those still conscience after the accident how long would it taken them die? being burnt alive?","57: People who compare the safety of civilians driving their cars to commercial flying are usually cooked. \nFilling a 50ton hunk of metal full of jet fuel and passengers, putting wings on it with jet engines and sending into the air at high speed will always be more dangerous than driving your car… if we all flew jet liners as much as we drive our cars, we’d be extinct 😂","58: Another slightly different analysis nothing about the birds lives but 'mysterious ' as though Migrating birds have is a mystery why build a runway so close to a bird sanctuary wetlands apologists for US plane makers","59: 9:40 Except for friction from the tail strike there was virtually no source for loss of speed. Even the engines didn't hit the runway or they would have been torn off, which they are designed to do. (For more on this look into the El Al crash into an apartment complex on takeoff in Amsterdam.) The plane floated off the end of the runway at 150mph. Contra the script, extensive death was very probable in this incident, with or without the reinforced berm.","60: You have not analysed the crash and evidence, You have only analysed the pilots. Why was the landing gear not deployed in the supposed bird strike video? It was taken less than a mile from the runway on final.This points to the possibility  the bird strike was before this was filmed and very likely the no 1 engine had already been taken out.","61: why no talk of the pilots background","62: False Flag, they just want to take our guns away people.  My bad, big Alex Jones fan, hard to shake that reaction to everything","63: Why a ciment/brick wall at the end of a runway , unheard of . was it to stop flying birds or birds flying","64: Working engine working foot\nThis is a memory rule that is fundamental. Flaps not deployable means you increase indicated approach speed accordingly. That is it\nTo me this is a panik response. Gears always come down unless the gear lever was extended above a system limit, typical on Airbus  aircraft, clearly documented and announced.","65: I wonder if an AI robot would’ve been able to land the plane safely","66: Airplane expert?","67: why do airplanes always burst into flames whenever it crashes, compared to car crashes, cars rarely burst into flames","68: from what I can gather this landing was plant it regardless of procedures,   all checklists went out the window so did chances of survival.","69: The problem with South Korean Airlines are the narcissistic attitude of crew members where they seem to think their time is worth more than other people's safety or other people's concerns. The flight attendants talk down to people in a condescending manner. They think they are above everyone... this attitude probably trickles into other areas of their quality of service. They do not have time to circle the airplane because THEY ARE TOO GOOD FOR DAT SHIET!?\n\nTAKE THE TIME TO DO IT RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!! who cares if you have to delay flights!","70: Talk about milking of a tragedy, Grande have no expertise to contribute to this situation. This Channel is on a moral decline.","71: You can pronounce it more like 'Jae-Joo'.","72: Since I believe you are a psychologist in training, I hesitated, even listening to this video. But I was quite surprised how well researched it was.","73: Not a bird strike \nJust poor cockpit management","74: Cheap ass airport is the fault.","75: I heard some stories that the wall was to blame since they could have slid to safety if they hadn't hit the wall😢","76: The sad part is, if they didn't build the reinforced concret wall, they probably would have been able to slow down.","77: Poor birds.","78: RIP and God bless those poor families having to deal with this horrible tragedy 😢 such unfathomable grief","79: If a bird strike did indeed cause this ,well every flight in the world should be grounded until the casue is established.  A bird strike on a plane is one of the most common incidents in aviation and if that's the case ,then flights should be stopped","80: Dr Grande ending on a sad note that AI will probably fare better than human pilots in the near future 😢","81: They said there was a bird strike and then the engine exploded.  Odds are the explosion took out essential flight systems, like hydraulics.","82: You forgot Theory #4 (the pilot was a North Korean) & Theory #5 (the pilot was pressured by North Koreans who abducted his family).","83: I heard Koreans are very racist to foreigners to visit their country so people should take this into consideration","84: Yes in Australia so many Asians crash. And I think they push themselves to perfection that they easily panic. And a lot of them drown in the sea too because they rush in. I also think that the cheap airline probably over worked their staff and probably cutting costs. As Asians God us MONEY. The film Japanese Story shows them as accident prone. They rushed to land and lost their cool.","85: The main fact remains that even if the pilots panicked and came in too fast , there was a huge reinforced concrete wall at the end of the runway that those poor people didn’t anticipate. This was an avoidable tragedy if that hadn’t been there.","86: No matter what they find during the investigation, it's immediately obvious that the plane landed safely. They came in fast because of the landing gear not deploying, but made a decent landing given that. Had there not been a fricking concrete barrier at the end of the runway, there's every chance there could have been minimal loss of life.","87: 😢 It's all pure speculation at this point.  Everyone needs to just let the investigators do their job.","88: I’m wondering if they had the bird strike, they went around and as they were going around they started to severely lose power in the working engine, leaving that engine at near to idle. In that case they’d be in a low energy state unable to circle the field and running out of time. \n\nIf the crew decided to focus on a relight attempt rather than manually deploying gear and the apu start up procedure, they would have been left exactly where we see them in the video. No flaps gear up out of energy and desperately trying to get the plane onto a runway. \n\nMy guess is that they were counting on a relight to save them and it didn’t happen in time before they ran out of energy.","89: Is there a landing gear release system that unlocks the gear doors and the landing gear and gravity will do the rest and it will lock the gear in the deployed state???","90: I’m full blooded Korean but born/raised in Los Angeles. My parents immigrated from Seoul, S. Korea. I don’t know anything about aviation to say what mechanical problems occurred in addition to the bird strike. I do know the Korean culture likes to rush! My entire life my Dad rushed me in everything I did! Koreans are hard working, quick learners, and book smart but very eager and at times impatient. The culture is not laid back like Americans. Koreans strive for perfection, take pride in their work, and have a strong sense of hierarchy esp towards elders and superiors. These traits though very disciplined can be a disadvantage when encountering stressful and unexpected situations. It wouldn’t surprise me if the subordinate airline staff and copilot didn’t question or go against the head pilot’s decisions. It wouldn’t surprise me if the pilots and airline crew panicked. Hopefully the 2 remaining airline crew survivors and the black box provide more information. Such a tragedy. I often get told by my American coworkers to slow down and relax. A lot of my American coworkers work at an extremely slow pace and don’t want to go the extra mile esp if not told to do so. Often they want to do the bare minimum and get paid. It can be frustrating for me. However, I’m very outspoken and not afraid to make suggestions to supervisors or disagree with what my coworkers are doing at work esp if it’s a safety violation and puts myself and others’ in harms way! Let’s hope negligence wasn’t a factor in this tragedy.","91: I'd be surprised to learn that the pilots panicked and simply forgot to deploy the landing gear and position the flaps.","92: Here's a video that discusses many of the technical aspects of the 737 that relate to rhis accident. This is the best technical review I've watched. \n\nChannel: Flying for Money\nTitle: 179 dead\n\nOne theory is that the bird strike may have caused an in-flight fire that created the need to land without delay.\n\nEnjoy!","93: Why Koreans put a structure on the path that not supposed to be there, they man made this disaster, 🫣, many would have survived, why not try  land on the vast open sea ? could have minimize casualties","94: Good grief!\nWho knew Dr Grande had so many subscribers who are aviation experts! 😅","95: A lot of Korean disasters because Korean leadership or authority are big ego or NPD environment.","96: Excellent analysis as always","97: I bet drones doing it and people are getting sick from mysterious drones fog globally","98: The story is ;The wall caused the explosion.\n             The C.E.O. of the airport is an ex policeman,politically appointed with no prior experience. \n            3.

Couldn't this contribute to confusion about the numerical order of the engines?","3: Excellent analysis Dr.Grande. Possibly number 3 as you stated seems most plausible.i believe the flight crew was preoccupied with getting the aircraft on the ground which could have affected their decision not to configure the aircraft for a normal landing(gear & flap deployment)","4: Shouldn’t that have been more survivable with it occurring so low and close the the airport?  I wonder what we can do as passengers do improve our chances of survival in a situation  like this?","5: I think the birds strike caused enormous damage, especially at the level of the hydraulic system broken somewhere, and  because of that, no flaps, no landing gear, no brakes, and that the landing for the pilots turned into a nightmare because of it.","6: Why are y’all acting like a fucking YouTube shrink has anything to add to an aircraft crash investigation? They haven’t even released the voice recorder and people are listening to opportunists like this guy talk out of pocket about something totally outside of their field of expertise. Todd Grande’s analysis of an airplane crash is worth about as much as Ariana Grande’s.","7: Planes should have an intelligent automatic response guidance to a pilot when detecting troubles from different modules inside of it because every parts has its feedback sensors, it will run quick calibration sequence make fast assessment then guide the pilot, and not require pilots to read very long procedural sequential manual in a very short period, it does not make sense. This should be visited in Aviation industry. \nAnother point, when shutting down one engine accidentally, it should provide feedback to the pilot quicky then he can reinitiate restart engine, and it must be a fast activation. Human factor is limited and should be reinforced. \nJust my few cents.","8: Hello Dr Grande, perhaps the pilots were experiencing time pressure. Maybe they were close to finishing their duty time. Maybe they were fatigued because of a lack of rest. I wanted to ask if you have any experience as a pilot, you are well versed in aviation topics.","9: Very good analysis of the Human Factor element in this event. \nSouth Korean operators have been involved in pretty serious accidents that were caused by, as the reports revealed, by culture, cockpit gradient and a generalised tendency to find confort in \"staying in the box\" rather than thinking critically.","10: I know nothing of aviation but as much of a problem as bird strikes have been...what kind of solution have we tried to find? Would some sort of screen disrupt airflow too much? Or can we have blades strong enough to obliterate birds without them destroying massive engines?

Both of these have happened before and they both can cause major failure of important systems.","19: How sad frightening for them \nCould be bird's strike's","20: I think personally you are stretching the margins of your remit here. There are flight recorders and an international air investigation going on. Too much speculation as is the way with instant social media.","21: How about the possibility that the aircraft had still too much speed? And so, it was impossible to get the landing gear out (like the Pakistani airline 8303 which crashed between the houses)...","22: It is all fine and dandy but same type of plane belly landed in Oslo on same week... That is very suspects...","23: @Dr. Todd Grande you know there are reaction videos , your videos are none reaction videos, what videos are you making exactly like really , what is the point of your videos but seeing your todd face? \nConclusion? Education? I don't understand why you are making videos\n\nyou can not even stick to your topics , you're just following trends.","24: I'm an aviation geek (non pilot)... This is, on the fare of it..a fantastic set of assumptions. Dr Grande you are \"flying high' in this episode","25: All i know is smoke in any situation puts your brain in fight or flight mode. If the pilots smelled, saw or even got a wiff of fire almost all training would become second to what our brains are trained through evolution to do, which is get out immediately..","26: Insightful and certainly got me thinking. That is great analysis and journalism Dr.","27: There is a great discussion @Pilot Debrief titled \"what no one is saying about\" this disaster. The graphics are excellent.","28: Your third opinion is most likely correct but this panic situation will never be officially admitted.","29: The flight attendants in the back are only a few feet from the last row of passengers... That few feet is the toilets... The only survivors of this crash were saved by the toilets...","30: I do not like the new automatic play feature. I can't be alone there.","31: Botched up landing that did not have to happen.","32: Likely cause is pilot fatigue. Led to bad decisions.","33: They could have done a turn around to land on water as last ditch recourse.","34: this might be a dumb question… why they don’t put like steel net infront of the engine so if bird does strike it get caught up and not go into the engine","35: The wall of death","36: Thank you for reminding us of airline safety statistics! I'm about to go on a long flight and was petrified, so this is so reassuring. ❤","37: 10:30 but there are far more cars out there than there are planes so there are far more injuries from auto accidents reported","38: I see many comments reaching to a hasty conclusion that the pilots' panicking mainly caused the crash.\nRemember, innocent until proven. Furthermore, there were multiple cases of the airline employees exposing the poor state of the safety checking procedures of their company months or even years before this incident. It is now also estimated that for whatever reason(could be birds, or could be poor repairment), both engines of the plane broke down minutes before the crash. Because of this factor, the plane could just drop dead straight from the sky but(as you can see from the footage) it landed without exploding. All the passengers could've survived if it wasn't for that goddam wall. So it could be the case that both pilots stood calm and tried their best to save those 180 people.\nI'm not a family member or whatsoever of the pilots, I'm just sad that they are getting blamed for the crash(without enough evidence!) after meeting their demise in such a horrible way.","39: One thing I’d like to comment on was, the engine that was supposedly inop due to the bird strike was in fact producing some thrust and you can see it when it came in to land. Losing all hydraulics is possible only if they have lost both engines: 1) they could have mistakenly shut down engine no. 1.  At this point, they would not have time to go over any checklists and just came in to land without gears nor flaps. 2. Seeing that they had some control over the aircraft when tear dropping and coming into belly land, I could have sworn at least one of the engines was producing some thrust, in fact it was engine no. 2 (the one that suffered a bird strike and subsequently a compressor stall), and if thats the case it doesn’t explain why they didn’t have the gear down because the hydraulics would have been working. So was it because they were so rushed and had no time to just extend the gears? 3. As a pilot on the final I would have carried on to land the bird with flaps 15 if I had only one engine working but then again I wasn’t presented with the parameters they were presented witn the stress they had in a limited amount of time.","40: I used to be a 777 pilot, now I’m rated on the A320 in Europe. Just wanted to appreciate your knowledge in aviation, dr grande. For someone who’s profession and field of study is psychology, I felt like I was listening to a fellow pilot analyze and talk about the crash while watching your video. Kudos to you and there are so many armchair pilots who put out as much as videos as possible on the crash but yours even though you do not claim to be someone you are not is very well organized and informative. Thanks dr grande!","41: Sorry Dr Grande , you are factually incorrect @13.15 you say that no power is necessary for flap deployment. Wheras this is true for the landing gear (after uplocks are released from the flight deck) , for flaps then electric power is necessary for alternate flap deployment-which is quite a slow process.","42: Empty fuel","43: 2:58…milliseconds before this plume of smoke exits the right engine, a tiny plume exits the left one. You cannot see this in your video footage, but in this particular viral video. It’s worth looking into, as nobody has mentioned it anywhere.","44: Panic case mate","45: Even if that burm wasn't there the plane was traveling so fast it would have smashed into the outer airport security wall and the outcome would of been exactly the same. Let's stop talking about the ils antenna wall and really investigate and get into what the hell the pilots were doing and thinking and saying. This is clearly pilot error in the fact that they obviously handled the single engine bird strike issue poorly. Once the cockpit voice recorder data is extracted we will know exactly what happened.","46: All this talk about what these pilots shouldn`t have done and all that they should have done. If the antennae at the end of the runway had been frangible, they wouldn`t have died. Even if your plane is punctured by anti-aircraft flak as was the case with the Azerbeijani plane, many on board can still survive even if you don`t land on a runway. But this can only happen when you don`t hit an anti tank grade barrier seconds after crash landing","47: also the pilots were flying since 2 am,  when the birdstrike occured at 9 am they werent in there best mental condition to make the correct decisions. The whole incident whether we like it or not is due to pilot error, the concrete wall complicated all the errors and made it fatal for everyone. Without the wall, this would have been another gear up landing (with no injuries) which is fairly common in the industry, with 2 occuring in the same week.","48: The wheels didnt come down,its a hydraulic problem, which is a system powered by the engines","49: You should talk about the Russian-Azerbaijani flight that crash in Kazakhstan due to an anti-drone system","50: “Captain Sum Ting Wong,” “Wi Tu Lo,” “Ho Lee Fuk” and “Bang Ding Ow.","51: Your calculations are incorrect. How many people travel in cars are on the road vs airplane. You might fly once or twice a year on average. But in the car everyday. Your statistics are flawed.","52: The pilot ask the steward which engine is off 😮😮 the steward says the one on the right. Captain says which one? The stew heard says yes .","53: 💕 Very well said ✅","54: I was on the same flight type of plane and same airline but I’m so lucky I wasn’t on a plane that day","55: It is no comfort to anyone to hear that flying on a plane is safer than traveling in a car.","56: @1:28 Covid 19 didn't disrupt operations, our (over) reaction to the head cold did. \nReason for the crash? Was it a DEI hire panic? \nFor those still conscience after the accident how long would it taken them die? being burnt alive?","57: People who compare the safety of civilians driving their cars to commercial flying are usually cooked. \nFilling a 50ton hunk of metal full of jet fuel and passengers, putting wings on it with jet engines and sending into the air at high speed will always be more dangerous than driving your car… if we all flew jet liners as much as we drive our cars, we’d be extinct 😂","58: Another slightly different analysis nothing about the birds lives but 'mysterious ' as though Migrating birds have is a mystery why build a runway so close to a bird sanctuary wetlands apologists for US plane makers","59: 9:40 Except for friction from the tail strike there was virtually no source for loss of speed. Even the engines didn't hit the runway or they would have been torn off, which they are designed to do. (For more on this look into the El Al crash into an apartment complex on takeoff in Amsterdam.) The plane floated off the end of the runway at 150mph. Contra the script, extensive death was very probable in this incident, with or without the reinforced berm.","60: You have not analysed the crash and evidence, You have only analysed the pilots. Why was the landing gear not deployed in the supposed bird strike video? It was taken less than a mile from the runway on final.This points to the possibility  the bird strike was before this was filmed and very likely the no 1 engine had already been taken out.","61: why no talk of the pilots background","62: False Flag, they just want to take our guns away people.  My bad, big Alex Jones fan, hard to shake that reaction to everything","63: Why a ciment/brick wall at the end of a runway , unheard of . was it to stop flying birds or birds flying","64: Working engine working foot\nThis is a memory rule that is fundamental. Flaps not deployable means you increase indicated approach speed accordingly. That is it\nTo me this is a panik response. Gears always come down unless the gear lever was extended above a system limit, typical on Airbus  aircraft, clearly documented and announced.","65: I wonder if an AI robot would’ve been able to land the plane safely","66: Airplane expert?","67: why do airplanes always burst into flames whenever it crashes, compared to car crashes, cars rarely burst into flames","68: from what I can gather this landing was plant it regardless of procedures,   all checklists went out the window so did chances of survival.","69: The problem with South Korean Airlines are the narcissistic attitude of crew members where they seem to think their time is worth more than other people's safety or other people's concerns. The flight attendants talk down to people in a condescending manner. They think they are above everyone... this attitude probably trickles into other areas of their quality of service. They do not have time to circle the airplane because THEY ARE TOO GOOD FOR DAT SHIET!?\n\nTAKE THE TIME TO DO IT RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!! who cares if you have to delay flights!","70: Talk about milking of a tragedy, Grande have no expertise to contribute to this situation. This Channel is on a moral decline.","71: You can pronounce it more like 'Jae-Joo'.","72: Since I believe you are a psychologist in training, I hesitated, even listening to this video. But I was quite surprised how well researched it was.","73: Not a bird strike \nJust poor cockpit management","74: Cheap ass airport is the fault.","75: I heard some stories that the wall was to blame since they could have slid to safety if they hadn't hit the wall😢","76: The sad part is, if they didn't build the reinforced concret wall, they probably would have been able to slow down.","77: Poor birds.","78: RIP and God bless those poor families having to deal with this horrible tragedy 😢 such unfathomable grief","79: If a bird strike did indeed cause this ,well every flight in the world should be grounded until the casue is established.  A bird strike on a plane is one of the most common incidents in aviation and if that's the case ,then flights should be stopped","80: Dr Grande ending on a sad note that AI will probably fare better than human pilots in the near future 😢","81: They said there was a bird strike and then the engine exploded.  Odds are the explosion took out essential flight systems, like hydraulics.","82: You forgot Theory #4 (the pilot was a North Korean) & Theory #5 (the pilot was pressured by North Koreans who abducted his family).","83: I heard Koreans are very racist to foreigners to visit their country so people should take this into consideration","84: Yes in Australia so many Asians crash. And I think they push themselves to perfection that they easily panic. And a lot of them drown in the sea too because they rush in. I also think that the cheap airline probably over worked their staff and probably cutting costs. As Asians God us MONEY. The film Japanese Story shows them as accident prone. They rushed to land and lost their cool.","85: The main fact remains that even if the pilots panicked and came in too fast , there was a huge reinforced concrete wall at the end of the runway that those poor people didn’t anticipate. This was an avoidable tragedy if that hadn’t been there.","86: No matter what they find during the investigation, it's immediately obvious that the plane landed safely. They came in fast because of the landing gear not deploying, but made a decent landing given that. Had there not been a fricking concrete barrier at the end of the runway, there's every chance there could have been minimal loss of life.","87: 😢 It's all pure speculation at this point.  Everyone needs to just let the investigators do their job.","88: I’m wondering if they had the bird strike, they went around and as they were going around they started to severely lose power in the working engine, leaving that engine at near to idle. In that case they’d be in a low energy state unable to circle the field and running out of time. \n\nIf the crew decided to focus on a relight attempt rather than manually deploying gear and the apu start up procedure, they would have been left exactly where we see them in the video. No flaps gear up out of energy and desperately trying to get the plane onto a runway. \n\nMy guess is that they were counting on a relight to save them and it didn’t happen in time before they ran out of energy.","89: Is there a landing gear release system that unlocks the gear doors and the landing gear and gravity will do the rest and it will lock the gear in the deployed state???","90: I’m full blooded Korean but born/raised in Los Angeles. My parents immigrated from Seoul, S. Korea. I don’t know anything about aviation to say what mechanical problems occurred in addition to the bird strike. I do know the Korean culture likes to rush! My entire life my Dad rushed me in everything I did! Koreans are hard working, quick learners, and book smart but very eager and at times impatient. The culture is not laid back like Americans. Koreans strive for perfection, take pride in their work, and have a strong sense of hierarchy esp towards elders and superiors. These traits though very disciplined can be a disadvantage when encountering stressful and unexpected situations. It wouldn’t surprise me if the subordinate airline staff and copilot didn’t question or go against the head pilot’s decisions. It wouldn’t surprise me if the pilots and airline crew panicked. Hopefully the 2 remaining airline crew survivors and the black box provide more information. Such a tragedy. I often get told by my American coworkers to slow down and relax. A lot of my American coworkers work at an extremely slow pace and don’t want to go the extra mile esp if not told to do so. Often they want to do the bare minimum and get paid. It can be frustrating for me. However, I’m very outspoken and not afraid to make suggestions to supervisors or disagree with what my coworkers are doing at work esp if it’s a safety violation and puts myself and others’ in harms way! Let’s hope negligence wasn’t a factor in this tragedy.","91: I'd be surprised to learn that the pilots panicked and simply forgot to deploy the landing gear and position the flaps.","92: Here's a video that discusses many of the technical aspects of the 737 that relate to rhis accident. This is the best technical review I've watched. \n\nChannel: Flying for Money\nTitle: 179 dead\n\nOne theory is that the bird strike may have caused an in-flight fire that created the need to land without delay.\n\nEnjoy!","93: Why Koreans put a structure on the path that not supposed to be there, they man made this disaster, 🫣, many would have survived, why not try  land on the vast open sea ? could have minimize casualties","94: Good grief!\nWho knew Dr Grande had so many subscribers who are aviation experts! 😅","95: A lot of Korean disasters because Korean leadership or authority are big ego or NPD environment.","96: Excellent analysis as always","97: I bet drones doing it and people are getting sick from mysterious drones fog globally","98: The story is ;The wall caused the explosion.\n             The C.E.O. of the airport is an ex policeman,politically appointed with no prior experience. \n            3.

However, as headlines spotlight rare and catastrophic failures, a question lingers: is the Boeing 737 still the safest choice in the skies? Air travel promises speed, convenience, and unparalleled safety. But when unthinkable events like the Juu Air crash force us to pause on a quiet Sunday flight, such as Alaska Airlines Flight 1282's descent into South Korea's Muan International Airport ending in flames, leaving only two survivors out of 181 passengers and six crew members, it forces us to question. The incident was preceded by a bird strike warning, landing gear malfunction, and a medical call. Investigators questioned whether Boeing jets are still the trusted workhorses of the skies. Much has been said about Boeing's culture; we've heard those concerns loud and clear. Our culture is far from perfect, but we're taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity and are committed to moving forward with transparency and accountability, elevating employee engagement every step of the way. The collapse started appearing after the two crashes in 2018 and 2019, linked to a faulty stabilization system. Since its reintroduction, the Boeing 737 Max has not flown without an incident; it hasn't stopped doing its \"bad behavior.\" They have a culture of concealment, going over many years, stemming from the top—CEO, Boardroom—to save money and conceal problems with the Max. After six years of development for the Max 8 and Max N, on January 5th, 2024, Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 was on its way from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California. Minutes after takeoff, part of its fuselage blew out; a door plug, fitted in place of an unused emergency exit, fell off the plane and caused a rapid loss of cabin pressure, tearing the cockpit door open. Despite the pilots being forced to make an emergency landing, fortunately, none of the 171 passengers or six crew members were seriously injured. Since the incident, the FAA carried out inspections on 40 of the grounded Boeing planes but there are airlines who currently function with the faulty Boeing 737 Max9 planes as part of their fleet. United Airlines has at least 79 Boeing jets; Alaska Airlines have at least 65; Copa Airlines have at least 29; AeroMexico have at least 19; Turkish Airlines and Kazakh Civil Airlines each have at least five Boeing jets in their fleet, while Icelandair, Lion Air, and Dubai Airlines each have four and three Boeing jets respectively. Statistically, air travel remains the safest form of transportation.","comments":["0: People and media should be really be questioning why was there a wall at the end of the runway?

One ground observer reportedly stated that the Jeju Air 737 flew through a flock of birds during this first approach. A number of popping sounds came from the aircraft’s engines after it hit the birds. Its landing gear was extended at this time.\r\n\r\nThe flight crew went around and declared a MAYDAY soon afterwards. At this time, it is not clear how much damage the Jeju Air 737 suffered after hitting those birds. However, its pilots soon decided to immediately return to land on runway 19, i.e. the other end of the runway.\r\n\r\nBoth engines could be locked in full thrust from the go around, landing gear is retracted, flaps stowed and the aircraft gains speed and altitude but then it appears that the pilots were unable to deploy the landing configuration due to uncontrolled thrust as the flaps, slats because gear would be ripped off above a certain speed. \r\n\r\nAn uncontained failure in one of its engines might have caused extensive damage to the landing gear, flight controls, and engine controls.\r\n\r\nWhat is clear is the pilot chose to put the plane on the ground as quickly as possible, which is ideal when losing hydraulic fluid and subsequent control of the aircraft. One major contributing factor is the concrete wall that should never have been there! I have no doubt that if a collapsible antennae was installed as it should be, more people would be likely alive today.\n\r\n-Nalliah Thayabharan","73: If It is Boeing then i am not going.","74: *This was pilot era.

Several visuals showed the rear of the aircraft was absolutely intact. Physics plays a role in this: the nose absorbs the impact in frontal accidents while the tail can detach, preserving lives. A study by the Aviation Safety Network analyzed the middle seat in the back of the plane and found it had the lowest fatality rate at 28%, compared to seats further forward with a fatality rate of 44%. Seats in the back of the cabin had the lowest mortality rate at 32%. Not all plane crashes play by the same rules. Being close to an emergency exit can matter even more than sitting in the back, because the faster you can get out, the better your odds are in fires or water landings. This makes section seats near exits a smart choice. Despite their proximity to the plane's fuel tanks, these sections remain safer due to this proximity. Despite recent tragedies and the fundamental mistrust of Boeing, passengers still hold onto the belief that air travel remains safe. Yet, more travelers have begun using the \"if it's a Boeing then I'm not going\" strategy.","comments":["0: People and media should be really be questioning why was there a wall at the end of the runway?

Its landing gear was extended at this time.\r\n\r\nThe flight crew went around and declared a MAYDAY soon afterwards. At this time, it is not clear how much damage the Jeju Air 737 suffered after hitting those birds. However, its pilots soon decided to immediately return to land on runway 19, i.e. the other end of the runway.\r\n\r\nBoth engines could be locked in full thrust from the go around, landing gear is retracted, flaps stowed and the aircraft gains speed and altitude but then it appears that the pilots were unable to deploy the landing configuration due to uncontrolled thrust as the flaps, slats because gear would be ripped off above a certain speed. \r\n\r\nAn uncontained failure in one of its engines might have caused extensive damage to the landing gear, flight controls, and engine controls.\r\n\r\nWhat is clear is the pilot chose to put the plane on the ground as quickly as possible, which is ideal when losing hydraulic fluid and subsequent control of the aircraft.

Did the pilots forget to lower the undercarriage? That seems perplexing, as there are many warnings in a cockpit if the undercarriage isn't lowered—particularly the ground proximity warning system, which sends off very significant alarms. There are many questions here that beg answers. These answers will come from the black boxes, which will be recovered from the tail and the investigation led by South Korean authorities along with Boeing and CFM International. JAYU Airlines has a good safety record; South Korea in recent times has had a good safety record. The 737-800 is the workhorse of the world and has a great safety record, being the most reliable aircraft around. One possible clue: This particular 737 did have a diversion on a flight from JAYU to Beijing two days ago; it had to divert to So. No details are given of why that aircraft had to divert, but this possibly is a clue. Also, there are suggestions that the pilots couldn't lower the undercarriage due to hydraulic problems. Well, with the 737 as with most aircraft, you can crank the undercarriage down. Did the engine failure cause a situation in the cockpit where they simply didn't have time to do this?

A nation in shock mourns the loss of 179 lives following a tragic Juju Air crash, as South Korea initiates an emergency safety inspection of all airline operations. Flags fly at half-mast while the government and investigators launch an exhaustive audit of all Boeing 737800 aircraft operating domestically. President Cho Sang-Moong, newly appointed just two days prior to the disaster, vows to overhaul the aviation safety system for a safer Republic of Korea amidst the grief. Another Juju Air jet faces a landing gear issue, forcing it to return to Gimpo Airport shortly after takeoff. Investigators target a landing gear malfunction, bird strikes, and weather conditions as possible causes of the crash, which resulted in a devastating belly landing. The crash investigation reveals potential hydraulic failure and issues with the landing gear, along with problems with the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Families of the victims face the painful process of identifying their loved ones, with bodies so badly damaged that officials need more time. Questions arise about a concrete wall at the end of the runway, unusually tall and possibly exacerbating the catastrophe when the jet hit it before exploding. The crash investigation reveals that the concrete wall at the end of the runway was unusually tall and did not meet aviation safety standards. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommends that runway safety areas remain unobstructed to allow aircraft in distress to overrun safely, but the wall's location directly violated these guidelines, raising concerns about whether proper oversight had been exercised during its construction. Warnings signs ignored: Records show prior incidents at the same airport with pilots reporting insufficient runway length and unsafe obstacles near the runway’s end. These warnings went unaddressed. Experts suggest this lack of action demonstrates a systemic failure to prioritize safety, with airport authorities potentially ignoring red flags to save costs, impacting an explosion as the jet overran the runway, striking the concrete wall resulting in catastrophic damage to the aircraft's fuel tanks and an explosion. Aviation safety analysts argue that had the wall been replaced with a collapsible safety barrier or if the runway had been extended, the crash and subsequent fatalities might have been avoided. This has led to widespread criticism of airport safety practices, criminal negligence allegations, legal experts, and victims' families labeling the airport's failure to address the concrete wall as criminal negligence. They argue that the airport authorities knowingly endangered lives by disregarding safety protocols and recommendations.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d102fe"},"video_id":"4SEOVgOS9JQ","title":"Shocking safety concerns  emerging in the  Jeju Airline  Crash","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SEOVgOS9JQ","text":"Lawsuits are now being filed with demands for accountability and significant reforms to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.

The investigation reveals multiple layers of negligence, both within the airline itself and at regulatory levels. Initially, the focus was on the drone collision as a catastrophic accident caused by reckless testing by a multinational conglomerate. However, it soon became clear that this tragedy was not just an isolated incident but a result of a series of failures. The investigation uncovered that the private security firm had filed a flight plan for another drone test on the same day as Flight 2216's crash. This led to the realization that the Drone had been tracking multiple aircraft, including Flight 2216, before colliding with it. The log from the microchip matched the path of Flight 2216 and three other flights in the days preceding the incident. The lead investigator concluded that this was not just a test but a deliberate act to intercept and disable enemy aircraft. This revelation shocked everyone involved, including military representatives who had previously dismissed the possibility of sabotage. The intercepted communication confirmed that the Drone's target was indeed the airport, not the plane itself, suggesting that Flight 2216 was merely collateral damage in this larger scheme. The whistleblower from the conglomerate provided crucial evidence and testimony, revealing that the drone was never supposed to be near the plane; it was a glitch that management had known about but failed to fix. This information added another layer of culpability to those involved, including the private security firm and the conglomerate itself. As the investigation concluded with a damning report, the world saw headlines condemning both negligence and sabotage as causes for the disaster. The media coverage intensified public outcry, leading to widespread protests demanding justice for the victims and stricter regulations on drone technology. Governments around the globe called for a ban on autonomous drone testing in civilian airspace, recognizing that technological advancements must not come at the cost of human lives. In response, South Korea faced sanctions from other countries over its failure to regulate the technology adequately. The conglomerate was slapped with lawsuits and criminal investigations, highlighting the severity of their actions.","comments":["0: This is not only totally inaccurate, but disrespectful to all involved.

Stay with us as we uncover the tragic story behind this devastating event. Jedu Airflight 2216 was a regular scheduled international passenger flight that departed from Suvarna Pumi Airport in Bangkok at 2:29 AM local time, destined for Muan International Airport in South Korea. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, a twin-engine narrowbody jet known for its reliability and efficiency. On board were 181 people, including passengers and crew. At 8:54 AM local time, Jedu Airflight began its descent into Muan International Airport. The area was blanketed in dense fog, reducing visibility significantly. Weather conditions at the time of departure were calm with no reported issues; the flight progressed smoothly at first. At 8:57 AM local time, just moments before its first landing attempt, the aircraft reportedly encountered a bird strike. The impact caused significant damage to critical systems. The crew immediately declared a Mayday and aborted the Landing for a second attempt. On the second attempt to land, the aircraft faced another complication: the landing gear failed to deploy. This left the Boeing 737-800 with no option but to attempt a belly landing at 9:04 AM local time. The aircraft made a belly landing and tragically overshot the runway, skidding across the tarmac at high speed. It collided with a reinforced concrete wall, causing a catastrophic explosion. The crash site was engulfed in flames. Emergency responders worked tirelessly to rescue survivors; out of 181 on board, 179 tragically lost their lives.

This devastating event led to the loss of 179 lives, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in South Korea in over 20 years. Join us as we examine the timeline of the crash, the investigation into its causes, and the lessons we can learn from this incident. JU Air flight 2216 was a scheduled passenger flight from JU International Airport to Muang International Airport on the afternoon of December 29th, 2024. The Boeing 737-800 aircraft with 175 passengers and six crew members aboard attempted to land at Muang airport. Tragically, after a bird strike just prior to landing, the aircraft lost control and skidded off the runway, striking a concrete barrier. The crash resulted in an explosion, and all passengers and crew members on board were tragically killed, except for two survivors who were flight attendants seated at the rear of the aircraft. The sequence of events leading to the crash began with a bird strike shortly before landing. While the plane continued its approach, the landing gear failed to deploy, causing the aircraft to land sliding off the runway and colliding with a concrete barrier at the end. This impact caused a massive fireball that further escalated the destruction. Preliminary investigations suggest that while the plane passed pre-flight inspections, it encountered unforeseen technical issues during its approach to the runway. The South Korean government has launched a thorough investigation into the crash. Early findings suggest that the aircraft had no significant technical issues before takeoff. The investigation is currently focusing on the bird strike, the failure of the landing gear to deploy, and the presence of a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, which may have contributed to the severity of the crash. The crash has raised important questions about airport safety, particularly regarding the use of concrete barriers at the end of runways. Experts argue that such barriers should be made from materials designed to minimize damage in the event of a crash. Following the incident, there have been calls for revising safety regulations at airports to ensure that such barriers are more frangible. The South Korean government is expected to examine airport infrastructure standards closely in the wake of the crash. JU Air CEO Kim Bay has announced a series of measures aimed at restoring public confidence in the airline, including cutting back flight schedules, implementing rigorous maintenance protocols, and offering compensation packages for the victims' families. The airline is also facing heightened scrutiny, and the industry as a whole is reflecting on this disaster as a catalyst for enhanced safety procedures.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10303"},"video_id":"P-mvLOZN0Dk","title":"The Tragic Story of Jeju Air Flight 2216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-mvLOZN0Dk","text":"In this tragic event, only two individuals survived: both were flight attendants seated at the rear of the aircraft.

In the days following the crash, South Korean society mourned its losses. The government declared Muang a special disaster zone and announced a period of national mourning until January 5th, 2025. Families of victims united in their grief, refusing to hold funerals until all bodies were identified. DNA testing became necessary for identifying many of the victims, a process that would take days. The investigation now has become an international effort. Teams from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration, and Boeing have joined South Korean authorities. They face a challenging task: finding the flight data recorder, which was found partially damaged. The tragedy has forced a hard look at aviation safety standards in South Korea. All Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the country are undergoing emergency inspections. The positioning of navigation equipment at airports nationwide is being reviewed. Perhaps most significantly, questions are being raised about the balance between commercial pressures and safety margins in the airline industry. The Juu Air flight 2216 disaster serves as a stark reminder that in aviation, there is no such thing as a small oversight. For the families of the 179 victims, these investigations offer little comfort; their lives have been forever altered by the events of December 29th, 2024. What do you think caused the loss of lives? The pilots' actions, the bird strike, or the improperly built localizer?

The head of the transport ministry's investigation team announced on Tuesday that there was evidence of bird feathers in at least one of the ill-fated Boeing 737-800's engines, which were moved to a hanger for a full examination in the last few days. The other engine is still being checked for clues, but that doesn't yet mean we can blame a bird strike for the accident. With many seeking answers, not least relatives of the victims who had been traveling from Bangkok to Manan on December 29th, the ministry's lead investigator noted even if a bird strike was severe, it does not immediately cause the engine to shut down. Post-accident images show that the number two engine, which had spewed smoke and flames, had several fan blades missing. The other engine is relatively intact but its status during landing remains unclear. Video footage of the ill-fated passenger jet reveals a gear-up landing with what sounded like engine noise, suggesting at least one engine was operating. Especially since the thrust reverser on the number two engine looks like it was deployed, which cannot be said for the other engine.","comments":["0: Then where is the black box?

Birds DO get sucked in the jet's turbine engines.   Jeju's Boeing 737's turbine engines have design features that ensure they can shut down after ingesting birds. The engine does not have to survive the ingestion, just be safely shut down and landed.  \n\nThere were other more,  MAJOR reasons why passengers were killed; several *pilot errors*  which caused the death of the passengers. \n\n*Feather did not kill the passengers*\n\n\nWhere is the LANDING GEAR?\n\nWhere is the CONCRETE WALL?","6: Bird strike and pilot error, Unfortunately.","7: The pilots realised too late on approach that they had shut down the wrong engine. They were committed to a go-around on the compromised engine due to bird strike. No doubt they were trying to restart the good engine. They didn't deploy flaps or undercarriage as these create drag, OK if you have power, but not if you have no thrust. If it were a planned approach on one engine, they would gave notified the tower for fire support as brakes can overheat on a one engine landing, they would also have used flaps and nose up angle of attack to slow the aircraft  as much as possible and used the whole of the runway.","8: Yeah there tends to be feathers in the engines when they ingest birds, surprising isn't it?","9: Yes and that's why they died...","10: What a tradegy is, thery landed niceky, they still alive, they still plane, we seeing it, but couldn't make the palne to stop or couldn't make them out...\n\nThis is the worst disaster n death","11: Bird strike, panic, shutdown wrong engine, botched power-off 180 return to land at too high a speed (like 500km/hr), failed to (or decided not to) deploy flaps/gear, unfortunate giant berm at end of runway.

Its blades were not broken away, nor do they appear to have rotation damage from the collision. It is clear from videos that the reverser was not actuated, indicating the engine was probably shut off. The right engine clearly shows damage from possible bird strike and likely rotation on collision, reverser actuated as well as  thrust vapour (as per video). I think it safe to assume that the pilots believed they only had one working engine (right damaged engine) but with only partial power and decided to land immediately as a result. It will be interesting to see the results from data and voice recorders to see if the wrong engine was shut down in the panic of the moment.","15: Still doest answer why they didnt land right away and doing a go aroind?!?","16: So?

Sure, you can say the road can be better designed, and have all trees plucked/walls removed from a 100m radius from the roads, but there are always constraints in the environment. Furthermore, blaming the bad design of the airport after the crash on hindsight is also simple. Additionally, no one knows how the crash would have been even without the \"wall\". With the plane still travelling at almost 160 knots, it could just as easily disintegrate/flip etc as the plane continues rolling on the ground, especially with the engines built below the fuselage acting like a \"scoop\". And if the plane still doesnt stop there, what about all the non airport buildings beginning 400m south of the \"wall\"???

Please focus on why they do not deploy the landing gear manually.  Next, explain why the air brakes, the flaps were not deployed as can be seen in the video.  The wings were still in flight mode instead of curving downwards to create air resistance.  The only thing that the pilot did was to deploy the cascade design thrust reverser.  To stop the aircraft, you deploy the thrust reverser, you deploy the airbrakes and flaps and you lower the engine speed and of course you use the wheel brakes, but this time it is understandable the wheel brakes is not the question since it was not even deployed.  Focus on the relevant matters.  Bird strike is so common.  It will not lead to failure of landing gear deployment.  It is operated hydraulically and also can be deployed manually using your hands and pulling on the 3 levers on the floor of the cockpit.  1 of the lever is for nose wheel, 1 for left landing gear and 1 for the right landing gear.  Not possible that they do not know this manual method.","77: Have we forgotten about all the shrapnel holes in the rear of the fuselage?","78: A single bird strike should not cause the engine to stop making power.","79: Thrust reversers were never deployed it was the fan cowl doors pushed up as it is carrying the load and was deformed as evident in the video...

Here's today's story: In a devastating aviation disaster, the Juu Air flight that crashed on December 29th at Muan International Airport in South Korea has raised numerous questions as investigators piece together the events leading to the tragedy. The crash resulted in the loss of 179 lives, marking it as the deadliest air accident on South Korean soil. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders, crucial for understanding the moments leading up to the crash, ceased recording approximately 4 minutes before the aircraft collided with a concrete structure at the airport. This revelation has left both investigators and families of the victims in shock. Sim Gong, a former transport ministry accident investigator, expressed his surprise at the missing data, suggesting it could indicate a complete power failure of the aircraft, including backup systems—a rare occurrence in aviation. The South Korean transport ministry announced plans to conduct a thorough analysis of the circumstances surrounding the black boxes' failure. Initially examined in South Korea, they have since been sent to a laboratory in the United States for further analysis, in collaboration with the National Transportation Safety Board. Juu Air flight 7C2216 had departed from Bangkok and was approaching Muan when it encountered a series of critical issues. Two minutes prior to the crash, pilots reported a bird strike to air traffic control and declared an emergency. They attempted to abandon the landing by initiating a go-around maneuver but instead made a sharp turn and crashed without its landing gear deployed, resulting in a fiery explosion upon impact with an embankment at the end of the runway. The embankment, designed to support the localizer system that assists aircraft during landing, was positioned so close to the runway. Investigators are now scrutinizing this decision's safety implications. Some families of the victims have voiced concerns regarding the investigation's leadership, urging for the involvement of independent experts to ensure transparency and thoroughness in the inquiry. As the investigation unfolds, many are left grappling with unanswered questions surrounding the crash: Why did the black boxes stop recording? What role did the bird strike play in the disaster? And why was the concrete wall positioned where it was? The answers to these questions may take weeks to uncover as investigators sift through available data and eyewitness accounts. Meanwhile, families of the victims await closure and answers to the tragedy that has left a deep scar on South Korean aviation's landscape. The transport ministry promised to keep the investigation transparent and share findings with victim's families as they work to uncover the truth behind this catastrophic event.

Passengers settled into their seats; some looking forward to reuniting with loved ones, others on business or vacation trips. The crew attended to their duties, ensuring everyone's comfort and safety. As the plane approached Muan, disaster struck. Pilots reported a bird strike and declared an emergency. Moments later, the plane could no longer maintain its flight. It belly-landed on the runway with only moments to react. Pilots declared an emergency and made a desperate attempt to land safely. What should have been a smooth journey was now a race against time. With 1 life hanging in the balance, it became a race against time. The chaos and destruction were immediate and devastating. Rescue workers sprang into action but the flames consumed the aircraft, making their efforts arduous. Only two crew members sitting in the tail section survived the inferno. Emergency responders tirelessly controlled the blaze and searched for survivors. The scene was chaotic with families and loved ones waiting in agonizing anticipation for news. The tragedy left an indelible mark on the community and nation. Memorials were held, and families grieved the loss of their loved ones.

Investigators worked around the clock, collaborating with international experts to piece together the events that led to the tragic crash. To shed light on possible causes, aviation experts analyzed various factors, including the bird strike, mechanical failures, and crew responses. They suggested that while a bird strike could cause engine failure, it shouldn't have prevented manual extension of the landing gear. Experts reconstructed the flight's final moments, examining data and considering all possible scenarios. The exact sequence of events leading to the crash remains under scrutiny. Investigators left no stone unturned. The exact cause of the crash is yet to be determined. Authorities are working tirelessly to piece together the final moments of JU Air Flight 7C 2216.

Well, journalist Jen Moon joins us on the line from the crash site in Muan. Welcome, Jen. What were police looking for and what did they find during their raids on Juj Air and Manan International Airport operator? Police conducted search and seizure operations today at three different locations: Muan International Airport, Juj Air office in Seoul, and the regional aviation office. Officials told me that the search warrant was issued over charges of professional negligence resulting in deaths. Today, police were seen combing through the remains of the crashed aircraft at the airport. They are also trying to secure evidence related to the legitimacy of the airport's localizer, a concrete wall housing an antenna array located near the runway at the time of the crash. They have secured communication records between the control tower and the pilot shortly before the crash. Investigators plan to seize documents and materials related to the operation and maintenance of the aircraft as well as the operation of airport facilities. This is not usual for such a case, considering the unusualness and highly unlikely nature of this aviation disaster in South Korea. The public believes that this is only due diligence on the part of the police. What should we read into the fact that Juj Air's chief executive has been banned from leaving the country? Police did explain that although the CEO Kim Bay and another high-ranking official of the budget airliner haven't been charged, they imposed a ban because these officials can prove to be main witnesses or Andor testifiers to the accident. At minimum, Juj Air spokesperson said the company was assessing the situation but reducing flight operations as early as next week in response to growing concerns over safety. Flights operated by this carrier have no indication at this stage of what likely caused this. Well, inspectors have retrieved both black boxes from the charred remains of the aircraft and earlier today they completed decoding data from the cockpit voice recorder. They had previously said that they were aiming to finish that procedure by tomorrow. The complete audio files from the cockpit voice recorder includes all communication from the final two hours of that Juj Air flight last Sunday, ranging from communications between the control tower and pilots, dialogue between flight crew, and even the slightest noise in the cockpit, alert warnings, and sounds of switches being turned on and off. It is expected to be a huge help in finding out what transpired in the final moment.","comments":["0: In Korea, those in charge flee abroad if something goes wrong.","1: First, we MUST all pray for the victims families who are suffering in such grief.

So here you go. Things that people do not know if you are not korean. \n\n1. That company had similar issues(I mean air craft related) and even whistle blowers told and wrote people to not to take the airline as they cut engineers to maintain aircrafts. So they have engine issues every month. Pilots left a lot because of that. The workers already knew this kind of incident will happen\n\n2. Jeju airline is a part of 애경(ae kyeon) group which had The most killed humidifier incident in Korea. They already have killed so many people while knowing the problem but doing nothing and run away. Dead: around 1,740. Injured: around 5,902. \n\n3. He didn’t do anything about 11 hours. And the first place he went, is the front of reporters. Not the bereaved or even survivors. He did say sorry there but not to any families face to face. Not at all. \n\n4. Even before the investigation started, he consistently told to reporters that the accident is not their fault. But the aircrafts were already in so much troubles as I wrote above. \n\n5. This is exactly what they did before when humidifier incident happened.  We all assume that he will leave the country and wait until it goes down. \n\nHe needed that. \nEven more, we are keep talking about why he is Not in custody.","43: The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna??,,","44: Remember them saying they lost all contact and transponder when they struck the birds that means both engine generators stopped and the backup battery was out of service it had to have failed also for the transponder to stop transmitting and they lost all hydraulics from both system a and b because both engines stalled you can see more than ten white birds on both sides of the plane and the witness who filmed it heard 2 or 3 loud bangs that is both engines stalling. No hydraulics from a because no left engine and no pressure from system b because a cut line near the pump when birds bent or broke a blade and a piece hitting the line cutting it at the pump before any fuses and it explains why you can see a dark plume of liquid right next to the white cloud, So no hydraulics no flaps no air brakes and no power they were a glider and you can see a lot of damage on the right engine in the approach video. \n     \n     They were able to restart the right engine because you can see a heat plume behind that engine about 10 feet before the landing but no heat behind the left engine and they still landed perfectly using the backup flight control cable system for the three control surfaces Elevator, Rudder and ailerons awesome pilots so they opted for a wheels up landing knowing they would stop a lot faster than rolling on wheels with no hydraulic brakes and might have even thought that dirt berm would help slow them down safely how could they know it was loaded with 2 foot thick concrete foundation. \n\n     I think they are going to find a broken blade, A cut hydraulic line on the right engine and a battery with no voltage.

This follows a police raid of Muan Airport and the airline's offices in the capital, Seoul. Local media say a warrant was issued for charges of professional negligence resulting in death. 179 people were killed when the passenger jet crashed and slid into a wall, bursting into flames. Many questions remain unanswered, and investigators are looking at whether a bird strike or weather conditions were responsible. When investigators have started the process of extracting data from the plane's black boxes, Aviation expert Jeffrey Thomas explained why these flight and voice recorders are so important: \"Well, the two black boxes are absolutely critical to most investigations, particularly this one. They are actually orange or red in color. One is the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which records the last two hours of cockpit conversation. The digital flight data recorder (DFDR) is the heartbeat of the airplane and monitors basically every major system on the aircraft. It has a capacity of up to 25 hours of recording.\"\n\nThe CVR, as you suggest, has been downloaded, and they are now working on the transcript of that. They expect it to be released within the next day or so.","comments":["0: 이같은 사고가 전세계에서 일어나지 않기를 바랍니다","1: Very bad","2: This is a tragedy.

That obstacle at the end of the runway was unfortunate, but the plane had 2,6 kilometres of runway to land and stop well before hitting the mound. No high lift devices were deployed to slow the 737 before landing, and the landing gear had not been deployed to brake hard immediately after touchdown. My guess is that the crew panicked, perhaps because Jeju Air (a low cost airline)  may have skimped on simulator training for their pilots (too expensive?). If so, the plane or the pilots are not to blame. If the high lift devices and undercarriage had been deployed the 737 would have slowed during the approach, and thus should have stopped easily. However attempting a \"belly up landing\" meant that the plane skidded with high speed and little friction between the asphalt and the metal bottom of the 737 and its engines. They had no hope to stop in time. I´d put the blame on that low cost airline which probably recruited young persons with little experience (cheap), and did not offer enough training like expensive simulator sessions to handle any possible emergencies. As a former pilot (from sailplanes/soaring to instrument flying) I believe that you`d want to  keep your distance if the aviation operators/persons you meet are not 100% solid & top notch.","9: Najľahšie sa hádže vína na mŕtvych.

The opening and opperation of the airport itself was a rush. \nEven the wall that the airplane had crashed was there for the plane data sending device (since the landscape was not suitable for it to be a international airport) \nDue to the landscape they were trying to extend the landing strip which has been reported that muan's airports airstrip is much shorter than Incheon international airport airstip. \nWhich is a reason why many Koreans (including myself) is asking the government and the Airport Corporation why they rushed the opening of muan airport eventhough it was not ready in so many parts.\n++ this area is full of  bird eco-system and eventhough there are guidelines to protect the planes from bird crashing, none of these guideline were nor ready or there were not enough employees to follow the guidelines. Which is another coincidence where we could tell the muan airport was not ready to be operated as international airport. \n\n+ from the video many experts has shown respect to the captain of the plane. We were able to tell that till the very last moment of crash he did not take his hands of that steering wheel, he tried everything he could do hoping that he could save someone with his hands grabing the wheel till his last breathe.

I hope everyone involved is given strength and resilience to go through this tragedy.","35: It's fascinating how anger makes people experts in things they barely understand. Here's the basic fact: the wall was there before the runway started, doing what walls do—being stationary. The plane landed in the opposite direction and hit the wall.\n\nWhy the pilot chose that approach is a mystery for now, known only to him and the air traffic controller. Hence, the black box is crucial. Based on logic, this points to human error. So maybe blame poor decision-making, not the wall. \n\nAfter all, the wall didn’t suddenly leap into the plane’s path. It’s not auditioning for the final destination.","36: The person that should be banned is whoever gave permission to build a wall at the end of a runway.","37: This is my interpretation of what happened:\n\nFrom the footage seen on the internet, it appears that a bird strike struck the right hand side engine leading to a go around performed by the pilot. It appears the flaps were extended and the gear was not lowered at this point.\n\nDuring the attempted go around, the flaps were retracted and the pilots attempted to switch off the engine.\n\nWhen the aircraft landed, we can see that the reverse thrust was deployed in the supposedly damaged engine and the air around it appeared “fuzzy” suggesting hot exhaust air and an operational engine. However, this was not the case for the undamaged engine which did not have this “fuzzy” effect.\n\nThis suggests the pilots had quite possibly turned off the wrong engine which has happened before.\n\nThis also could explain why the pilots did not enter the standard holding pattern on the go around and performed a short manoeuvre to return to the runway as they may have been confused why they had no power. They were relying on a partially damaged engine.\n\nWith no engine power, the pilots wouldn’t have been able to lower the flaps and gear without using the back up systems. For the landing gear, that would be gravity extension, and for the flaps, that would be an electric motor which both take a considerable amount of time.","38: High possibility they shut down the wrong engine during go around. Then they needed to turn 180 for rwy 19 with a tailwind touching down half way down the rwy.

While many are focused solely on the concrete wall, the reason Jeju Air is receiving particular attention in Korea is that the same aircraft had previously experienced issues, and concerns about inadequate inspections have been raised for several other aircraft as well. Since the accident occurred due to a failure in the landing gear deployment, the airline cannot avoid accountability as well as the constructor of airport.","64: They deserve to be investigated.

The moment the police or justice system gets involved and you start punishing people evidence will start to be destroyed. I suggest that anyone knowledgable about accident investigation would comment on this. I would also expect an expert to know the difference between big G, the gravitational constant and little g, a measurement of acceleration due to Earth’s gravity (1 g is 9.81 metres per second squared at the Earth’s surface). You need yet another expert - this one’s broken.","73: I am surprised how quickly all bodies have been identified and doubt of how accurate is this done in 2, 3 days since the air crash and surprised at the same time that the victims identification has been concluded before releasing the cockpit tapes. I thought it would be the other way around. why is it taking so long to release those tapes?? When the Cargo plane crashed in Latvia last month where 3 people survived, the cockpit/tower communication was quickly made public.","74: Preventing the CEO to leave the country?  Yeah, he will disappear and seek asylum in Russia right?  Wild witch hunt begins.  If the pilots/crews were alive Korean authorities would have arrested them for treason.  Beyond idiotic air port designer, auditor, air port management, Korean authorities.  At beginning, Koreans were so obsessed with the damn bird.  Nobody was talking about the concrete barricade when it was so obvious what the direct cause of tragedy.  After foreign media zeroed in to the wall, then only then Koreans go..oh yeah...that wall...really?  Every dog and cat goes to colleges in Korea and that tells you a lot.","75: Even if the hydraulics had gone, the wheels can still be dropped, by pulling handles in the floor, behind seat","76: Bird strike does NOT cause landing gear failure. There is more to this","77: Weather conditions?  The weather was perfect.","78: I would expect that the Jeju corporation and its executives would be part of this investigation.  \nThere very well may be a problem with corporate culture, where pilots were expected to do everything possible (no matter how risky) to \"save\" an expensive airplane rather than do everything possible to save lives.  Also, there may be problems with pilot selection, certification and training that needs to be looked into.  Personally, I think it is highly unlikely that there is a corporate level problem, but it must be part of any investigation.  \n\nIt is my opinion that there were very many mistakes made immediately after the bird-strike and long before the plane hit the berm; the recorders should answer some very vexing questions.

The opening and opperation of the airport itself was a rush. \nEven the wall that the airplane had crashed was there for the plane data sending device (since the landscape was not suitable for it to be a international airport) \nDue to the landscape they were trying to extend the landing strip which has been reported that muan's airports airstrip is much shorter than Incheon international airport airstip. \nWhich is a reason why many Koreans (including myself) is asking the government and the Airport Corporation why they rushed the opening of muan airport eventhough it was not ready in so many parts.\n++ this area is full of  bird eco-system and eventhough there are guidelines to protect the planes from bird crashing, none of these guideline were nor ready or there were not enough employees to follow the guidelines.

From the RWY touchdown markers to the wall it is 9028.8 ft. The RWY length is 9186 ft. ((9571÷27s)×60m×60s)÷6076.12=210 kts.

What does the CEO of airline have to do with this terrible accident? Its combination of stupid reinforced concrete wall design and poorly executed emergency landing (far too horizontal like a typical landing with landing gear) with a tailwind. In emergency landing scenario without landing gear pilot has to take advantage of all available measures to slow down the aircraft whether air resistance or physical contact with the ground..... overshooting the runway was inevitable and really bad idea on a short runway","24: The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna??,,,","25: So many people still blaming everything on the wall, do you see people with group think heads not thinking and appying their brains using other factors.The pilots made a couple of errors which they should not have made but given the training and experience there are many factors that could have led to them not thinking properly at the time...which is still unacceptable for a pilot","26: Remember them saying they lost all contact and transponder when they struck the birds that means both engine generators stopped and the backup battery was out of service it had to have failed also for the transponder to stop transmitting and they lost all hydraulics from both system a and b because both engines stalled you can see more than ten white birds on both sides of the plane and the witness who filmed it heard 2 or 3 loud bangs that is both engines stalling. No hydraulics from a because no left engine and no pressure from system b because a cut line near the pump when birds bent or broke a blade and a piece hitting the line cutting it at the pump before any fuses and it explains why you can see a dark plume of liquid right next to the white cloud, So no hydraulics no flaps no air brakes and no power they were a glider and you can see a lot of damage on the right engine in the approach video. \n     \n     They were able to restart the right engine because you can see a heat plume behind that engine about 10 feet before the landing but no heat behind the left engine and they still landed perfectly using the backup flight control cable system for the three control surfaces Elevator, Rudder and ailerons awesome pilots so they opted for a wheels up landing knowing they would stop a lot faster than rolling on wheels with no hydraulic brakes and might have even thought that dirt berm would help slow them down safely how could they know it was loaded with 2 foot thick concrete foundation. \n\n     I think they are going to find a broken blade, A cut hydraulic line on the right engine and a battery with no voltage.

So its not pilot fault😭😭 stop blame the pilot","34: I can empathize with the bereaved families, but I can also understand that it is not that easy to properly examine and identify all 179 victims in a short period of time. I hope everyone involved is given strength and resilience to go through this tragedy.","35: It's fascinating how anger makes people experts in things they barely understand. Here's the basic fact: the wall was there before the runway started, doing what walls do—being stationary. The plane landed in the opposite direction and hit the wall.\n\nWhy the pilot chose that approach is a mystery for now, known only to him and the air traffic controller. Hence, the black box is crucial. Based on logic, this points to human error. So maybe blame poor decision-making, not the wall. \n\nAfter all, the wall didn’t suddenly leap into the plane’s path. It’s not auditioning for the final destination.","36: The person that should be banned is whoever gave permission to build a wall at the end of a runway.","37: This is my interpretation of what happened:\n\nFrom the footage seen on the internet, it appears that a bird strike struck the right hand side engine leading to a go around performed by the pilot. It appears the flaps were extended and the gear was not lowered at this point.\n\nDuring the attempted go around, the flaps were retracted and the pilots attempted to switch off the engine.\n\nWhen the aircraft landed, we can see that the reverse thrust was deployed in the supposedly damaged engine and the air around it appeared “fuzzy” suggesting hot exhaust air and an operational engine. However, this was not the case for the undamaged engine which did not have this “fuzzy” effect.\n\nThis suggests the pilots had quite possibly turned off the wrong engine which has happened before.\n\nThis also could explain why the pilots did not enter the standard holding pattern on the go around and performed a short manoeuvre to return to the runway as they may have been confused why they had no power. They were relying on a partially damaged engine.\n\nWith no engine power, the pilots wouldn’t have been able to lower the flaps and gear without using the back up systems. For the landing gear, that would be gravity extension, and for the flaps, that would be an electric motor which both take a considerable amount of time.","38: High possibility they shut down the wrong engine during go around. Then they needed to turn 180 for rwy 19 with a tailwind touching down half way down the rwy. Totally pilot error.I would bet $1m bucks on it.","39: Hear me when I say, someone in the cockpit shut down the wrong engine.

They did the same with the sinking of MV Sewol - cost guard completely useless, the President nowhere in the picture then weaponizing the Secret Service to gaslight and terrorize people - and all they did is they blamed the owner who ended up committing suicide. The real question is this: what kind of idiot builds reinforced concrete structures next to airport runways?!","47: Bird strike cant cause a landing gear fault there has to be more to this story 🤔","48: That is the most ignorant BS I have ever seen.

What was the criminal act?","49: We need the CVR and FDR to be released...","50: You know what’s negligence is that stupid wall they put up near the runway","51: Unbelievably tragic to think that they stood more chance of survival landing in a nearby field than they did on the actual runway.","52: Come on Elon","53: People rightly saying the wall at the end shouldn’t have been there but also the pilot landed halfway down the runway. Rushed approach, should have gone around again and landed right at the start of the runway if the landing gear had failed.","54: Could be a result of Boeing cutting corners.

This should be practiced more in US and Europe.","55: LOW COST AIRLINES","56: Interesting details about the black boxes","57: Arrest ATC for suggesting that runway.","58: 🙏🙏🙏 *John 3:36* 🙏🙏🙏","59: The required safety end-of-runway area is 90 meters, while the ILS barrier was placed at 140 meters. After reviewing the airport's blueprints and maps, it’s clear that the airport was designed in compliance with regulations. If there’s blame to assign, it lies with the regulations, not the airport!","60: Rich corporates will now shift blame from airport authority for creating a wall instead, they will blame the dead pilots.","61: 🛑 This was more than just a bird strike","62: BONNÉE ANNÉE 2025 aux familles des vixtimes !","63: What makes this accident even more tragic is the high number of passengers who were either of the same last name (indicating family members) or of similar age (suggesting friends). While many are focused solely on the concrete wall, the reason Jeju Air is receiving particular attention in Korea is that the same aircraft had previously experienced issues, and concerns about inadequate inspections have been raised for several other aircraft as well. Since the accident occurred due to a failure in the landing gear deployment, the airline cannot avoid accountability as well as the constructor of airport.","64: They deserve to be investigated. What reason was it to place a concrete wall at the end of a runway?","65: Just depends on who has more money to shove the blame elsewhere..the JejuAir CEO or the Airport developer.. All else fails blame the birds or Boeing  or the pilots. Corruption everywhere","66: Not a wall. It was a structural slab (horizontal) on a fill berm for the ILS antenna.","67: love how jeju is being blamed, there was definitely some pilot error/fatigue involved but no one is speaking about the concrete wall and no EMAS at the end of the runway, that ultimately killed them,","68: This isn’t the airlines fault! That brick wall was, when the hell will they acknowledge this","69: Bbc not acknowledging the concrete wall?","70: WHY WAS THERE A CRASH TEST WALL AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY???!!","71: Well after they have survived an explosive fiery crash landing the black boxes have to be handled with museum gloves and transported on many layers of soft padding material to extract the delicate data","72: Arresting airline and airport employees is the worst way to start an accident investigation. The moment the police or justice system gets involved and you start punishing people evidence will start to be destroyed. I suggest that anyone knowledgable about accident investigation would comment on this. I would also expect an expert to know the difference between big G, the gravitational constant and little g, a measurement of acceleration due to Earth’s gravity (1 g is 9.81 metres per second squared at the Earth’s surface). You need yet another expert - this one’s broken.","73: I am surprised how quickly all bodies have been identified and doubt of how accurate is this done in 2, 3 days since the air crash and surprised at the same time that the victims identification has been concluded before releasing the cockpit tapes. I thought it would be the other way around. why is it taking so long to release those tapes?? When the Cargo plane crashed in Latvia last month where 3 people survived, the cockpit/tower communication was quickly made public.","74: Preventing the CEO to leave the country?  Yeah, he will disappear and seek asylum in Russia right?  Wild witch hunt begins.  If the pilots/crews were alive Korean authorities would have arrested them for treason.  Beyond idiotic air port designer, auditor, air port management, Korean authorities.  At beginning, Koreans were so obsessed with the damn bird.  Nobody was talking about the concrete barricade when it was so obvious what the direct cause of tragedy.  After foreign media zeroed in to the wall, then only then Koreans go..oh yeah...that wall...really?  Every dog and cat goes to colleges in Korea and that tells you a lot.","75: Even if the hydraulics had gone, the wheels can still be dropped, by pulling handles in the floor, behind seat","76: Bird strike does NOT cause landing gear failure. There is more to this","77: Weather conditions?  The weather was perfect.","78: I would expect that the Jeju corporation and its executives would be part of this investigation.  \nThere very well may be a problem with corporate culture, where pilots were expected to do everything possible (no matter how risky) to \"save\" an expensive airplane rather than do everything possible to save lives.  Also, there may be problems with pilot selection, certification and training that needs to be looked into.  Personally, I think it is highly unlikely that there is a corporate level problem, but it must be part of any investigation.  \n\nIt is my opinion that there were very many mistakes made immediately after the bird-strike and long before the plane hit the berm; the recorders should answer some very vexing questions.  I might add this: it is, by no means, entirely the fault that there was a concrete berm located long past the end of the runway in a place that is the normally the opposite end of that runway.  It is my opinion (based on the little that is known) that a properly done emergency landing should have had the plane stopped long before it hit the berm, or, better yet, the landing should have been done on the nearby water.

The opening and opperation of the airport itself was a rush. \nEven the wall that the airplane had crashed was there for the plane data sending device (since the landscape was not suitable for it to be a international airport) \nDue to the landscape they were trying to extend the landing strip which has been reported that muan's airports airstrip is much shorter than Incheon international airport airstip. \nWhich is a reason why many Koreans (including myself) is asking the government and the Airport Corporation why they rushed the opening of muan airport eventhough it was not ready in so many parts.\n++ this area is full of  bird eco-system and eventhough there are guidelines to protect the planes from bird crashing, none of these guideline were nor ready or there were not enough employees to follow the guidelines. Which is another coincidence where we could tell the muan airport was not ready to be operated as international airport. \n\n+ from the video many experts has shown respect to the captain of the plane. We were able to tell that till the very last moment of crash he did not take his hands of that steering wheel, he tried everything he could do hoping that he could save someone with his hands grabing the wheel till his last breathe. RIP Captain with respect.","12: I think the pilot were great to made a decision landing the airplane smoothly but sadly ending damage bcs of the wall :(((","13: Why are they not going after the person who authorized the construction of the WALL?","14: raiding everything but Boeing’s HQ","15: Sudo apt rektaaaa 😂😂😂😂","16: THE MUAN WALL","17: Should they raid Boeing too?","18: Dear BBC news, please Arabians is asking you kindly to sent out a message to all the manager off all the  airlines throughout the world, please to gave a proper maintenance to the airlines, before they take off flight, so that they will have a proper landing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..

From the RWY touchdown markers to the wall it is 9028.8 ft. The RWY length is 9186 ft. ((9571÷27s)×60m×60s)÷6076.12=210 kts.

What does the CEO of airline have to do with this terrible accident? Its combination of stupid reinforced concrete wall design and poorly executed emergency landing (far too horizontal like a typical landing with landing gear) with a tailwind. In emergency landing scenario without landing gear pilot has to take advantage of all available measures to slow down the aircraft whether air resistance or physical contact with the ground..... overshooting the runway was inevitable and really bad idea on a short runway","24: The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna??,,,","25: So many people still blaming everything on the wall, do you see people with group think heads not thinking and appying their brains using other factors.The pilots made a couple of errors which they should not have made but given the training and experience there are many factors that could have led to them not thinking properly at the time...which is still unacceptable for a pilot","26: Remember them saying they lost all contact and transponder when they struck the birds that means both engine generators stopped and the backup battery was out of service it had to have failed also for the transponder to stop transmitting and they lost all hydraulics from both system a and b because both engines stalled you can see more than ten white birds on both sides of the plane and the witness who filmed it heard 2 or 3 loud bangs that is both engines stalling. No hydraulics from a because no left engine and no pressure from system b because a cut line near the pump when birds bent or broke a blade and a piece hitting the line cutting it at the pump before any fuses and it explains why you can see a dark plume of liquid right next to the white cloud, So no hydraulics no flaps no air brakes and no power they were a glider and you can see a lot of damage on the right engine in the approach video. \n     \n     They were able to restart the right engine because you can see a heat plume behind that engine about 10 feet before the landing but no heat behind the left engine and they still landed perfectly using the backup flight control cable system for the three control surfaces Elevator, Rudder and ailerons awesome pilots so they opted for a wheels up landing knowing they would stop a lot faster than rolling on wheels with no hydraulic brakes and might have even thought that dirt berm would help slow them down safely how could they know it was loaded with 2 foot thick concrete foundation. \n\n     I think they are going to find a broken blade, A cut hydraulic line on the right engine and a battery with no voltage.

I hope everyone involved is given strength and resilience to go through this tragedy.","35: It's fascinating how anger makes people experts in things they barely understand. Here's the basic fact: the wall was there before the runway started, doing what walls do—being stationary. The plane landed in the opposite direction and hit the wall.\n\nWhy the pilot chose that approach is a mystery for now, known only to him and the air traffic controller. Hence, the black box is crucial. Based on logic, this points to human error. So maybe blame poor decision-making, not the wall. \n\nAfter all, the wall didn’t suddenly leap into the plane’s path. It’s not auditioning for the final destination.","36: The person that should be banned is whoever gave permission to build a wall at the end of a runway.","37: This is my interpretation of what happened:\n\nFrom the footage seen on the internet, it appears that a bird strike struck the right hand side engine leading to a go around performed by the pilot. It appears the flaps were extended and the gear was not lowered at this point.\n\nDuring the attempted go around, the flaps were retracted and the pilots attempted to switch off the engine.\n\nWhen the aircraft landed, we can see that the reverse thrust was deployed in the supposedly damaged engine and the air around it appeared “fuzzy” suggesting hot exhaust air and an operational engine. However, this was not the case for the undamaged engine which did not have this “fuzzy” effect.\n\nThis suggests the pilots had quite possibly turned off the wrong engine which has happened before.\n\nThis also could explain why the pilots did not enter the standard holding pattern on the go around and performed a short manoeuvre to return to the runway as they may have been confused why they had no power. They were relying on a partially damaged engine.\n\nWith no engine power, the pilots wouldn’t have been able to lower the flaps and gear without using the back up systems. For the landing gear, that would be gravity extension, and for the flaps, that would be an electric motor which both take a considerable amount of time.","38: High possibility they shut down the wrong engine during go around. Then they needed to turn 180 for rwy 19 with a tailwind touching down half way down the rwy. Totally pilot error.I would bet $1m bucks on it.","39: Hear me when I say, someone in the cockpit shut down the wrong engine.

They did the same with the sinking of MV Sewol - cost guard completely useless, the President nowhere in the picture then weaponizing the Secret Service to gaslight and terrorize people - and all they did is they blamed the owner who ended up committing suicide. The real question is this: what kind of idiot builds reinforced concrete structures next to airport runways?!","47: Bird strike cant cause a landing gear fault there has to be more to this story 🤔","48: That is the most ignorant BS I have ever seen. What's that fault here is nature and human error. What was the criminal act?","49: We need the CVR and FDR to be released...","50: You know what’s negligence is that stupid wall they put up near the runway","51: Unbelievably tragic to think that they stood more chance of survival landing in a nearby field than they did on the actual runway.","52: Come on Elon","53: People rightly saying the wall at the end shouldn’t have been there but also the pilot landed halfway down the runway. Rushed approach, should have gone around again and landed right at the start of the runway if the landing gear had failed.","54: Could be a result of Boeing cutting corners.

After reviewing the airport's blueprints and maps, it’s clear that the airport was designed in compliance with regulations. If there’s blame to assign, it lies with the regulations, not the airport!","60: Rich corporates will now shift blame from airport authority for creating a wall instead, they will blame the dead pilots.","61: 🛑 This was more than just a bird strike","62: BONNÉE ANNÉE 2025 aux familles des vixtimes !","63: What makes this accident even more tragic is the high number of passengers who were either of the same last name (indicating family members) or of similar age (suggesting friends). While many are focused solely on the concrete wall, the reason Jeju Air is receiving particular attention in Korea is that the same aircraft had previously experienced issues, and concerns about inadequate inspections have been raised for several other aircraft as well. Since the accident occurred due to a failure in the landing gear deployment, the airline cannot avoid accountability as well as the constructor of airport.","64: They deserve to be investigated. What reason was it to place a concrete wall at the end of a runway?","65: Just depends on who has more money to shove the blame elsewhere..the JejuAir CEO or the Airport developer.. All else fails blame the birds or Boeing  or the pilots. Corruption everywhere","66: Not a wall. It was a structural slab (horizontal) on a fill berm for the ILS antenna.","67: love how jeju is being blamed, there was definitely some pilot error/fatigue involved but no one is speaking about the concrete wall and no EMAS at the end of the runway, that ultimately killed them,","68: This isn’t the airlines fault! That brick wall was, when the hell will they acknowledge this","69: Bbc not acknowledging the concrete wall?","70: WHY WAS THERE A CRASH TEST WALL AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY???!!","71: Well after they have survived an explosive fiery crash landing the black boxes have to be handled with museum gloves and transported on many layers of soft padding material to extract the delicate data","72: Arresting airline and airport employees is the worst way to start an accident investigation. The moment the police or justice system gets involved and you start punishing people evidence will start to be destroyed. I suggest that anyone knowledgable about accident investigation would comment on this. I would also expect an expert to know the difference between big G, the gravitational constant and little g, a measurement of acceleration due to Earth’s gravity (1 g is 9.81 metres per second squared at the Earth’s surface). You need yet another expert - this one’s broken.","73: I am surprised how quickly all bodies have been identified and doubt of how accurate is this done in 2, 3 days since the air crash and surprised at the same time that the victims identification has been concluded before releasing the cockpit tapes. I thought it would be the other way around. why is it taking so long to release those tapes?? When the Cargo plane crashed in Latvia last month where 3 people survived, the cockpit/tower communication was quickly made public.","74: Preventing the CEO to leave the country?  Yeah, he will disappear and seek asylum in Russia right?  Wild witch hunt begins.  If the pilots/crews were alive Korean authorities would have arrested them for treason.  Beyond idiotic air port designer, auditor, air port management, Korean authorities.  At beginning, Koreans were so obsessed with the damn bird.  Nobody was talking about the concrete barricade when it was so obvious what the direct cause of tragedy.  After foreign media zeroed in to the wall, then only then Koreans go..oh yeah...that wall...really?  Every dog and cat goes to colleges in Korea and that tells you a lot.","75: Even if the hydraulics had gone, the wheels can still be dropped, by pulling handles in the floor, behind seat","76: Bird strike does NOT cause landing gear failure. There is more to this","77: Weather conditions?  The weather was perfect.","78: I would expect that the Jeju corporation and its executives would be part of this investigation.  \nThere very well may be a problem with corporate culture, where pilots were expected to do everything possible (no matter how risky) to \"save\" an expensive airplane rather than do everything possible to save lives.  Also, there may be problems with pilot selection, certification and training that needs to be looked into.  Personally, I think it is highly unlikely that there is a corporate level problem, but it must be part of any investigation.  \n\nIt is my opinion that there were very many mistakes made immediately after the bird-strike and long before the plane hit the berm; the recorders should answer some very vexing questions.  I might add this: it is, by no means, entirely the fault that there was a concrete berm located long past the end of the runway in a place that is the normally the opposite end of that runway.  It is my opinion (based on the little that is known) that a properly done emergency landing should have had the plane stopped long before it hit the berm, or, better yet, the landing should have been done on the nearby water.  Of course, my opinion is subject to falsification and again, the recorders' data will shed light on this.","79: Pilot didn't put landing gear down. What has Bird strike or weather have to do with the crews bollocks emergency landing?? Crock of shit","80: how does it take to download data from blackbox and read the files.... it's been almost a week....","81: Well nothing will come out  the truth .

HOWEVER, the reinforced CONCRETE WALL was the the DEFINING reason why these passengers are dead! Somebody High up there in the management hierarchy was probably trying to scrimp on money instead of evaluting the overall safety of crucial Airport infrastructures.","84: I have some important insider info to share. But Google keeps censoring and deleting my comments. Can you help me fight against the censorship BBC?","85: It’s the airport stupid.","86: 😢😢😢","87: \"How carefully do black boxes have to be handled?\" Why  is she paid so much when she asks such absurd questions?","88: About time we seeing an investigation into that kill wall that should not been there if not for that wall most if not all would be alive now. I think airlines need to carry out own risk assessments of all airports they fly into and not just go on airport say so. Should check if an airport is upto standards and check run off and what risks are there if plane has a problem.","89: Airplane accidents In most cases are a combination of factors which may include mechanical, weather, and human.\nIn this particular case as the aircraft was on final approach , # 2 engine suffered compressor stall, perhaps due to one or more bird strikes. The 737 is designed to fly on one engine, not affecting the hydraulic systems which operate the landing gear, flaps, spoilers and other control components. Even with both engines out they can turn on the APU to provide hydraulics and electrical power.\nProper procedure for pilots facing this scenario is to go around and do race track patterns, go through the checklists, and fully reconfigure the aircraft prior to attempt another landing. This is practiced in simulator during both initial and recurrent training. IMO the crew panicked and rushed a high speed  gear up no flaps uncontrolled  landing which likely could have been avoided, by following proper checklist and operational procedures. Both CVR and FDR will tell, but I'm almost sure lack of proper cockpit management played a huge role. R.I.P. all.","90: “Whether a bird strike or weather conditions were responsible” \n\nIt’s already been established the pilot called in a bird strike before his Mayday call. Catch up!","91: So.....nothing new.","92: Can people drop the bird strike nonsense? that was not responsible for this tragedy at all.","93: The concrete wall was not built in the end of the runway but in the beginning of it however runways are designed to be able to be used both ways \nAnd while there  might have been pilot error in this accident \nThe concrete wall or to be specific  the concrete fortress was not supposed to be built anywhere near this  runway. The airport must  be investigated and whoever’s idea was to build this fortress should be held accountable .

As South Korean authorities now say they will carry out a full inspection of the country's Boeing 737-800s, while US officials have landed here to help with the investigation. This morning, US Federal officials are joining the investigation into the horrific plane crash. The Boeing 737, with 181 passengers and crew on board, seen here skidding down the runway on its belly without landing gear, its engines scraping along the tarmac before crashing into a concrete wall. The aircraft then exploded, parts of the plane engulfed in flames and thick smoke. 179 killed, including five children as young as 3 years old, two people miraculously surviving: a male crew member now receiving treatment in the ICU, and a female crew member who is recovering. Korean investigators are retrieving partially damaged black boxes but say the cockpit voice recorder was intact. South Korean officials said that on Sunday at around 9:00 local time, the flight arriving from Bangkok issued a warning of a potential bird strike; two minutes later, the pilot made a Mayday call. The plane then made an unusually quick 180° turn and crashed moments later. Jedu is a low-cost carrier with an impeccable safety record. The airline's CEO bowed in apology, distraught family members gathering as the names of those who lost loved ones are read out. Jong's daughter was on board; he said she was almost home. Boeing released a statement saying they're working with Jedu and adding: \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones.

When the conservative president, who was pro-American, was impeached, a law was also passed to convert this awful airport into an international airport. \r\n\r\nWhat's even more suspicious is that the accident happened exactly 21 days after the law was passed. Doesn't that raise questions? \r\nI don't understand why a solid concrete localizer was placed at the runway, why anti-American, pro-China progressive politicians pushed for this airport to become international, why only one bird alert officer was on duty, or why the Air Traffic Controller directed the pilot to land in the opposite direction despite knowing about the concrete localizer. Isn't this all too suspicious? \r\n\r\nBut they overlooked that Boeing is the manufacturer of the aircraft. If they (politicians and medias) insist that the cause of the accident was an airframe defect, Boeing won't just sit quietly- they will bring everything to light.","35: How does a plane strike prevent landing gear and reverse thrustino? Nose was still high going down runway, indicating full thrust. Plus there are no lowerd flaps. This was more of a captain suicide.","36: So if you look close at the video where the white smoke is, When the plane struck the birds you can see on the left of the white puff a smaller darker cloud and hydraulic fluid is dark, When the plane hit the birds they bent or broke a blade causing a metal piece to fly around inside and cut a hydraulic line and all hydraulic pressure was bled off, That explains the small dark cloud of liquid and with an open circuit none of the pumps will work they just dump fluid on the engine and no pressure for anything. That is also why no flaps, No air brakes but the 737 can still control rudder, Elevators and ailerons with backup cables so they were able to land with control but without flaps your stall speed would be much higher explaining the high speed landing and it explains why they would choose a belly landing knowing they would stop faster skidding on the fuselage and engines rather than not having hydraulic brakes on rolling wheels so they opted not to deploy gear manually and might have even thought that dirt embankment for holding up fiberglass antennas would help safely slow them how would they know it was loaded with 2 foot thick concrete","37: Curious about if there is any “popped- up checklist for single (left engine) engine go around procedure for Boeing 737- 800” (the aircraft model in this crash)\n\nIf the aircrafts were smart enough, they might save people’s life, ensuring safer trips for everybody.\n\n\nFor those who sacrificed in this crash, please R.I.P. 🙏","38: യഥാർത്ഥ്യത്തിൽ ലാൻഡിംഗ് സമയത്ത് പുറകിലത്തെ വീല് കാണാമായിരുന്നു. പിന്നീട് അത് അകത്തേക്ക് വലിഞ്ഞു എന്ന് തോന്നുന്നു. ലോക്ക ഗ് സിസ്റ്റം ഫെയിലിയർ ആയി കാണും","39: Ban boing 737","40: They were so focused on a engine failure that they forgot to put the landing gear down how dumb can you be","41: The fact that could’ve been avoided is beyond heartbreaking 😢","42: Airports are supposed to be spacious enough for emergency landings!!!

That bird strike caused significant damage to right engine. Technically the pilots could have landed the plane safely with just one engine but they panicked and accidentally turned off the other engine that was working just fine. At this point in time the aircraft became a glider. Note that planes are designed to glide in the air without falling down  in case of an engine failure. At the point, the pilots made a decision to belly-land and INTENTIONALLY did not deploy the landing gear ( Planes are designed in such a way that even if the aircraft loses all engine power the pilots can still deploy the landing gear manually ) . In this case, however, the pilots intentionally chose NOT to deploy the landing gear and the flaps to gain more time for their landing ( At this point since they were gliding and going down fast, deploying the landing gear and the flaps would have lessened the time they had before reaching the airport ) so in order to gain more time to stay in the air they chose NOT to deploy the landing gear and the flops. However, there was one big obstacle in their way, the stupid concrete wall that was built at the end of the runway. Had the wall not been there most of the people, perhaps, all of the people would have survived as the end of the runway was just empty land.. \n\nIt is heart-breaking and sad to know that all these 179 people died when they could have been saved ..

You first see an error as they slowly started to descend. There was a stall in the left engine (seen on camera) by possible bird. That has nothing to do with the hydraulic landing gear though. Instead of the pilots staying in air to assess the situation, they decided to just bypass it and land.

One week after the deadly JEDU Air passenger plane crash that killed scores of people, most of the victims have now been returned to their families, according to authorities. 76 out of 179 victims have been returned; funerals are set to conclude over the next few days. The remaining three victims will be returned to their families on Monday due to personal reasons. With search and recovery work at the site of the accident concluding after three phases, authorities have recovered approximately 800 personal items. Of these, 204 items were returned to the victims' families; the remaining items will be available for families to check and recover themselves. In the case of electronic devices like cell phones, authorities plan to conduct digital forensics in order to return them. Most of the emergency shelters used by the families at the Muan International Airport are being removed. A joint memorial set up on the first floor of the airport will remain in place for 49 days, in line with Buddhist traditions and at the request of the victims' families. Meanwhile, the flight data recorder from the ill-fated plane has been sent to the US for analysis. South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced that the data extraction for the FDR cannot be performed in South Korea due to a missing connector; it was sent to the US National Transportation Safety Board earlier Monday morning.

On Chedu Airflight 2216, it was a trip home to be with loved ones after time away. The plane, a Boeing 737-800, was a common sight in the sky, scheduled for a regular flight from the busy city of Bangkok, Thailand, heading for Mu International Airport in South Korea. On board were 175 passengers from different countries, all excited to reach their destination; six crew members, dedicated to their jobs, were ready for the long journey. However, this ordinary flight would soon turn into a terrible event, shocking the nation and the world of aviation. The first sign of trouble appeared as Flight 2216 neared Mu International Airport. Weather conditions, known to change quickly in that region, had worsened; thick fog made the dangerous airport landing even more risky. Safety first, the crew made the tough but important choice to abandon the landing. The passengers, some likely worried by the sudden change, held on to the hope of a quick solution as Flight 2216 got ready for its second landing attempt. Ten minutes grew both in the cockpit and among the passengers; the weather was still a worry, but the crew relied on their training and skills to land the plane safely. A new danger arose: ground control's voices urgent and intense issued a frightening warning—bird strike. The crew confirmed their biggest fear had come true. This was no longer a normal landing; they were now dealing with multiple emergencies.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10318"},"video_id":"wel0jplA8MI","title":"Jeju Air Flight 2216: Tragic Crash and Investigation#shortvideo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wel0jplA8MI","text":"Despite the growing dangers, the crew chose to continue with the landing, hoping to overcome increasing difficulties. Disaster hit incredibly fast as Flight 2216 descended for its final approach. A vital system malfunctioned: the nose landing gear meant to soften the impact of touchdown would not come down. The plane now at the mercy of chance slammed into the runway with a terrible force; the impact shook the cabin violently, tossing passengers around like they were weightless. The plane out of control skidded off the runway, hurtling towards a concrete barrier at the runway's edge. The crash was devastating: the impact caused a massive fire, quickly engulfing the plane in flames and smoke. What once was a perfect Boeing 737-800 was now a twisted wreck—a reminder of the unforgiving nature of plane crashes. Emergency crews, their faces showing urgency and sadness, rushed to the crash site, fighting the fire and thick smoke to find survivors. They found a scene of unimaginable horror: the crash of Chedu Airflight 2216 took the lives of 179 people—a heartbreaking loss of life that shocked South Korea and the world. Two passengers' bodies, injured but miraculously survived, were pulled from the wreckage by heroic first responders. Their survival offered a small glimmer of hope amidst the devastation, offering little comfort to the families and friends of those who died in the tragedy. The nation mourned in the wake of the tragedy; flags were lowered to half as a sign of shared grief and respect for those lost in the crash. The South Korean government started a full investigation. Experts from South Korea, Boeing, and the US arrived at the crash site, their goal to reconstruct the events and determine the factors of the crash. The investigation quickly focused on several key areas: evidence suggested a possible bird strike near the engine; the landing gear failure became a subject of intense scrutiny. Investigators examined maintenance records for signs of problems and investigated the runway itself.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10319"},"video_id":"_-y3VcUI8c8","title":"Jeju Air crash: ‘Unusual elements’ of plane crash confuse aviation experts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-y3VcUI8c8","text":"We don't yet know why it was coming down without the undercarriage. Down Whether that was because the crew had planned to do a low-level flyby to get people on the ground an opportunity to look at the aircraft after the bird strike, whether it was the pressure of workload caused that or a mechanical problem we don't know. It's just all I can say is there are some unusual elements there. We're speaking to John Strickland now, director of the aviation firm JLS consultancy about that crash. The airline crash in South Korea. Hi, John, hi. So we've had quite a lot of suggestions today about what might or might not have happened and been the cause of that crash. Can you just tell us what officials are currently saying has happened? Well, we're not getting any clear information; it's very confusing accident. We've seen bits of footage of course. We saw the aircraft where there was a puff of smoke and a bit of flame out of one of the engines. And we heard the crew report a bird strike before the aircraft came to make its final approach. We've seen the terrible footage of the aircraft sliding down a runway and impacting with that object at the end of the runway, and questions about the fact it didn't have an undercarriage down. But we don't get anything clear yet. There has to be a full accident investigation; as you can imagine, takes time. There's a structure around the world about how these things are done. There's a lead investigator which in this case will be a representative from Korea because that's where the accident happened. And Boeing as a manufacturer of the aircraft and the engine, engine manufacturer also will be on that panel so they take time to get through the evidence. Sadly, there are no survivors who can give us any evidence that this time whether the two who did survive may help later. May be seen but there'll be an effort to listen to voice recorders, check through data even though I believe the flight data recorder itself is badly damaged so anything else unfortunate at this moment is speculation and do we know what sort of time we're looking at for actually seeing not perhaps the full probe as you speak of that but just some initial information about what might have actually happened here. I still think it would be running into months because the aircraft, as we've seen, is so badly damaged; scarcely anything recognizable apart from parts of the tail. And as I mentioned to get these data recorders out and indeed to listen to any transcripts with air traffic control with the pilots operating the plane, it is going to take time, and the protocol is not to put out a drip feed of information, not least for the respect to those whose lives were lost and those anxious relations who themselves are wondering what caused this tragedy. Even so, there are obviously concerns among some who might be looking at this and wanting to know exactly what had happened.","comments":["0: Why are they focused on a bird strike when a cement wall caused the damage?\r\nwho approve the concrete wall should be jailed...","1: Why?","2: Pilot should've attempted a sea landing rather than 'risk' landing on that runway without gear","3: This is really sad.

As far as I know Asians they are way too much about rules, instructions, traditions etc. They simply panic and they don't know how to react to a stressful and unexpected situation which is not described in their instructions.

Airtravel is still the safest way to travel in human history - oddly enough, even safer than walking when you run the data. Something happened on the plane that resulted in the aircrew needing to get that plane on the ground fast, between the mayday and the accident was around 6 monutes, not sufficient for all the check lists they would need to land normally, let alone in an emergency, so it must have been serious. All we can and should do, is wait for the Official Interim Report, as John Stickland said, this could take several months due to the state of the airframe, then wait for the Final Report - however long that may take - potentially a couple of years - and simply hope that the industry is able to glean lessons from what happened to improve air safety even more than it already is.

We saw the aircraft where there was a puff of smoke and a bit of flame out of one of the engines. And we heard the crew report a bird strike before the aircraft came to make its final approach. We've seen the terrible footage of the aircraft sliding down a runway and impacting with that object at the end of the runway, and questions about the fact it didn't have an undercarriage down.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing the plane skidding violently off the runway during its landing attempt, followed by a fiery explosion that engulfed the aircraft. The human toll: of the 181 individuals on board—175 passengers and six crew members—124 tragically lost their lives. Only two people, both flight attendants, survived but with significant injuries. For families and friends, the news was utterly heartbreaking, shattering lives forever. Initial theories and causes now: Preliminary investigations have revealed some startling possibilities. Landing gear failure; authorities believe the front landing gear failed to deploy, causing the aircraft to skid uncontrollably off the runway. Adverse weather at the time of landing: Visibility was reportedly low due to heavy fog, making conditions challenging for the pilots. Potential bird strike: There's also speculation that a bird strike may have damaged critical components during the approach. Each of these factors could have contributed to the crash. Investigators are working around the clock to piece together the exact sequence of events, including the role of fire and emergency response. The situation worsened when the plane collided with a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, sparking a massive fire. Emergency response teams were on site within minutes, and over 1,500 personnel worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze. Despite their heroic efforts, the fire consumed the aircraft quickly, complicating rescue operations. The broader impact: This crash is not just a tragedy for the families of the victims; it's also a wake-up call for the aviation industry. South Korea has seen few air disasters in recent years, but this incident marks one of the deadliest since 1997. Juu Air, the operator of the flight, is now under intense scrutiny as this was their first fatal accident in 19 years of operation. Investigation update: Investigators from South Korea's Aviation Authority, along with Boeing engineers, are currently examining blackbox data—the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder—these should provide crucial insights. Maintenance records were the aircraft properly inspected before departure? Pilot training and decision-making: Did the crew handle the emergency as best they could under the circumstances? Answers to these questions will be critical in preventing such a disaster from happening again. As we await more updates, one thing is clear: This tragedy could reshape global aviation safety standards. But was this accident truly unavoidable or were there warning signs that went ignored? Stay subscribed to our channel as we continue to follow this story and share the findings that could change everything.

The black box is holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crash of Ju-Air flight that left 179 people dead, which stopped recording four minutes before the disaster. South Korea's Transport Ministry said on Saturday: \"The Boeing 737800 was flying from Thailand to Mu-an, South Korea, on December 29th, carrying a total of 188 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at the Mu-an airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier. The analysis revealed that both the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) and FDR (flight data recorder) data were not recorded during the four minutes leading up to the aircraft's collision with the localizer. The Transport Ministry said in a statement, referring to the two recording devices: \"The localizer is a barrier at the end of the runway that helps with aircraft landings and was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.\" Plans are in place to investigate the cause of the data loss during the ongoing accident investigation. The statement added that South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash of Ju-Air flight 2216, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country. Investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear, and the runway barrier as possible issues.

Acting President Choy Sang Maach has called for urgent safety inspections of the nation's airline operations following a devastating plane crash that claimed 179 lives. Here’s what we know so far: The crash occurred on Sunday morning when Juu Air flight 7C to To6, operating from Bangkok, Thailand, crashed during its landing at Muan International Airport in South Korea. Tragically, 175 passengers and four of the six crew members were killed. When the Boeing 737-800 belly landed on the runway and erupted into flames upon colliding with a wall. Miraculously, two crew members survived and are receiving medical care. Emergency responders have been working tirelessly to recover victims and sift through the wreckage, which was almost completely destroyed by the fireball that engulfed the aircraft. Many of the victims were South Korean residents returning from holiday trips, along with two Thai nationals who also lost their lives in this heartbreaking incident. Investigations are underway. Authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the cause of the crash. Initial reports suggest that a bird strike reported by the pilots just before the incident may have played a role. The pilots declared a Mayday and attempted a go-around maneuver but were unable to prevent the crash. Investigators are also examining whether the aircraft's speed, landing gear deployment, and other factors contributed to the crash. The Ministry of Transport officials confirmed that the plane’s flight data recorder has been recovered but appears damaged; it remains unclear if the data can be fully retrieved. The crash site, located near South Korea’s western coastline, is under close scrutiny as officials analyze embankments and structures near the runway for any contributing factors. Government response and emergency measures are in place. Acting President Choy Sang Maach has prioritized identifying victims, supporting grieving families, and ensuring survivors receive the best care. In a disaster management meeting, he emphasized transparency in the investigation and urged swift action to reassure the public. The Transport Ministry is tasked with conducting an emergency safety inspection of South Korea’s entire airline operation system. A special inspection of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines is also under consideration. Muan Airport remains closed until Wednesday, while other airports continue normal operations. The impact and international involvement: Juu Air’s shares plummeted to record lows following the tragedy, reflecting public concern and grief. Under global aviation protocols, South Korea will leave the investigation with the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Boeing/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This disaster has cast a shadow over South Korea's aviation industry, prompting urgent calls for improved safety measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future. Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this horrific crash. The loss is immeasurable, and the pain is deeply felt. We will continue to follow this story closely and keep you updated on the investigation and recovery efforts. Mrs. Olivia, concluding that's all for now.

According to one of my colleagues, Mr. Jeff Thomas, who is a leading Aviation reporter and writer in Australia, it may have been the plane faced some sort of multiple system failure. Right after it declared Mayday, it stopped transmitting the ADS-B broadcast, which is the transmission that the plane has with air traffic controllers and others. Also, when it came for landing, you saw that the landing gear was not deployed, and the flaps were not set to the correct position, indicating maybe there was a multiple electrical failure after the bird strike. That to me is a little bit confusing. That's what we need really to wait until the cockpit voice recorder and data cockpit and flight data recorder be retrieved and read. Professor Mishari when you talk about that emergency system did mention there that it stopped transmitting at that point as well, which is not an emergency system; the system called ADS-B basically like a continuous transmitting information based on GPS and ground positioning satellites and some other information to air traffic controllers. According to Mr. Thomas who is a very reliable colleague when it comes to Aviation data, Jeff Thomas told me that right after the Mayday, the ADS-B system stopped transmitting information, which it's supposed to make that information automatically. Also, when you look at the landing gears, they were not deployed during the landing, and I'm also puzzled why the pilots and the first pilot and the first officer didn't deploy the landing gear manually because they have that option as well; could have been a multiple system failure. They were overwhelmed, overloaded, and that I don't know. That ADS-B system stopped transmitting information right after the bird strike which was something like 9 minutes before the crash. That is very confusing to me.","comments":["Comments disabled"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10321"},"video_id":"fPBZorf4Q40","title":"Aviation expert puzzled by sequence of events before Jeju Air Korea crash | ABC NEWS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPBZorf4Q40","text":"When you say it's puzzling, those multiple components would illuminate exactly what happened and the context around each of those particular systems and what was going on.

They made their call to go around as they were approaching the runway heading north, within seven minutes, they had made their approach back to the opposite runway. The hydraulic systems are not significantly impacted by a single engine out caused by a bird strike, as there are 3 separate hydraulic systems on board for redundancy in flight controls, with four hydraulic pumps total, two pumps being engine driven, and two pumps being electric motor driven (Specific to the 737). The landing gear has an emergency release that is actuated by a cable pull system located behind the center console that the co pilot is capable of reaching.\n\nNow with that being said, Seven minutes to run a missed approach procedure, trouble shoot failed systems, and to run the appropriate checklists to ensure the aircraft is safely configured to make a landing with the specific failures that they had suffered in flight, is simply not enough time. If you see any airliner suffer a casualty of any kind that isn't an immediate danger to the aircrafts ability to stay airborne (examples of this would be losing both engines, or an inflight fire in the cabin that is not able to be contained) they will often communicate with ATC and proceed to a holding pattern to trouble shoot their issues before returning to the airport. \n\nI want to know what happened in those seven minutes, if the right side engine during the bird strike caused the trust reverser to deploy causing significant drag and yawwing effect in the air since it would have only happened on one side, and i would certainly like to know why flaps were not extended, spoilers were not deployed (all hydraulically operated) yet the pilots were able to maneuver to turn around 180 degrees, align with the runway and establish and maintain a constant glide slope all the way down to the runway, using their flight controls, which are all hydraulically operated.","65: elephant in the room... pilot error","66: Did the pilots forget to engage the landing gear on the second attempt?","67: 1. Why don't you have the video of the engine blowing as seen from below. \n2. Why wasn't the gravity assist landing gear deployed?\n3. Why was that wall there?\n4.

Maybe we also should look into it as a secondary avenue thing and have awarness","72: My theory is that after the birds strike on the right engine, N2, there was alarms going off in the cockpit and panic follows. Most likely the pilots shut off the wrong engine, N1 (left one). That is why they were in a hurry to land. On one video we can see heat from the right engine but not from the left one. Only speculating. May they ALL rest in peace. God bless.","73: Korean pilots are to blame also, first of all there are other airports that is longer and safer to choose to land to.

Maybe showing the whole thing was a little insensitive maybe I don't know I'm just saying","76: In the cockpit there are three emergency handles. Each one releases the front wheel, or the two other wheel gears. They come down because of their own weight. No hydraulics, Why did not one of them come down? No mention of it to ATC. Last year in Pakistan the pilot forgot to lower the landing gear. The same happener some years earlier in India, (Spicejet). Were the Korean pilots so busy with the bird strike that they forgot to lower the landing gear? Was it DUI?","77: minimum control speed is 115 knots for the rudders on a 737","78: Please don't Blame it to Kim Jung Un or Putin!","79: Whos bright idea was it to put a big concrete wall at the end of the run way 🧐","80: My heart goes out to those left behind...to pick up the pieces...people like Mr Jeon Je-Young...to lose anyone close to you in such circumstances...utterly appalling...","81: the korean pilots are to blame also, they panicked and rushed to land, not even decreasing their speed and momentum when they tried to land at the middle of the runway where they should have known wasn’t a very long runway in the first place. i find it hard to believe a bird strike disabled the landing gear, and even if a flock of birds were sucked into the engine, the engine itself wouldn’t shut down immediately as they are designed to withstand to some extent bird strikes. in short the korean pilots judgement are also to blame. korean pilots have the worst track record in the oecd","82: It's really cruel and can't control my tears😢","83: Jesus! that wall is just ridiculous, nothing survives with a head on collision with a reinforced concrete wall."],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10323"},"video_id":"WVaoUbQ_ois","title":"Jeju Air plane crash: What happens to an aircraft when a so-called bird strike occurs? | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVaoUbQ_ois","text":"Authorities say the plane likely struck a flock of birds as it prepared to land, despite a control tower warning to the pilots. Julian Bray is an aviation security expert based in Cambridge, UK. We're going to have a little more about this awful accident now. After everything you've seen today, what is the most likely scenario that could have led to this tragic accident? First of all, deep condolences to everybody concerned. The pictures are truly shocking; I've seen some videos and I have to wonder how the pilot managed to land that aircraft level on the runway with no undercarriage at all. It failed to deploy, which is very worrying because they have backup systems so they can get the wheels down if you like. As it was scraping along the runway, the engine cowling was also scraping along the runway and there's no way they could deploy the flaps that act as an airbrake to slow down the aircraft. Here’s a scenario: The pilot likely attempted a landing on the runway only to crash into the wall because of the failure to deploy the landing gear. This caused the plane to veer off to the right and then for some hideous reason, there was a wall there, leading to the whole thing bursting into flames. I would have expected a fire on the runway itself but it didn't. As from as we've seen, the emergency workers were very brave and managed to get two of the crew members out from the rear section. The plane likely struck a flock of birds as it prepared to land, despite a control tower warning to the pilots. This is a popular aircraft: the Boeing 737-800; there are over 5,000 these aircraft around the world and flying with hundreds of Airlines. It's a complete mystery.","comments":["0: All the American media cuts out before impact ….

The hydraulic systems are not significantly impacted by a single engine out caused by a bird strike, as there are 3 separate hydraulic systems on board for redundancy in flight controls, with four hydraulic pumps total, two pumps being engine driven, and two pumps being electric motor driven (Specific to the 737). The landing gear has an emergency release that is actuated by a cable pull system located behind the center console that the co pilot is capable of reaching.\n\nNow with that being said, Seven minutes to run a missed approach procedure, trouble shoot failed systems, and to run the appropriate checklists to ensure the aircraft is safely configured to make a landing with the specific failures that they had suffered in flight, is simply not enough time. If you see any airliner suffer a casualty of any kind that isn't an immediate danger to the aircrafts ability to stay airborne (examples of this would be losing both engines, or an inflight fire in the cabin that is not able to be contained) they will often communicate with ATC and proceed to a holding pattern to trouble shoot their issues before returning to the airport. \n\nI want to know what happened in those seven minutes, if the right side engine during the bird strike caused the trust reverser to deploy causing significant drag and yawwing effect in the air since it would have only happened on one side, and i would certainly like to know why flaps were not extended, spoilers were not deployed (all hydraulically operated) yet the pilots were able to maneuver to turn around 180 degrees, align with the runway and establish and maintain a constant glide slope all the way down to the runway, using their flight controls, which are all hydraulically operated.","65: elephant in the room... pilot error","66: Did the pilots forget to engage the landing gear on the second attempt?","67: 1. Why don't you have the video of the engine blowing as seen from below. \n2. Why wasn't the gravity assist landing gear deployed?\n3. Why was that wall there?\n4. Why didn't the pilot dump most of the fuel prior to attempting to land.\n5. Why hasn't DW asked these questions to the relevant authorities.","68: That was awful my condolences to the family and friends of those onboard","69: Its been a terrible weekend..3 planes have crashes within 24 hrs of each other for failed landing gears! 1) so korean ..Boeing 737 ...deadly 2) KLM Oslo airport crash, Boeing 737..passengers safe 3) Canada fiery crash due to failed landing gear.","70: They should have installed barricade webbing system at the end of the runway not a freaking wall!","71: It does seems that Holidays time are prone to accidents and aviation accident if we include last year's Japan airline crash. Maybe we also should look into it as a secondary avenue thing and have awarness","72: My theory is that after the birds strike on the right engine, N2, there was alarms going off in the cockpit and panic follows. Most likely the pilots shut off the wrong engine, N1 (left one). That is why they were in a hurry to land. On one video we can see heat from the right engine but not from the left one. Only speculating. May they ALL rest in peace. God bless.","73: Korean pilots are to blame also, first of all there are other airports that is longer and safer to choose to land to. Seems they rushed everything, the plane is flying good.","74: if these things cannot be fixed imagine the tiny things that can cause disasters.","75: Damn DW doesn't skimp out on the explosions. Maybe showing the whole thing was a little insensitive maybe I don't know I'm just saying","76: In the cockpit there are three emergency handles. Each one releases the front wheel, or the two other wheel gears. They come down because of their own weight. No hydraulics, Why did not one of them come down? No mention of it to ATC. Last year in Pakistan the pilot forgot to lower the landing gear. The same happener some years earlier in India, (Spicejet). Were the Korean pilots so busy with the bird strike that they forgot to lower the landing gear? Was it DUI?","77: minimum control speed is 115 knots for the rudders on a 737","78: Please don't Blame it to Kim Jung Un or Putin!","79: Whos bright idea was it to put a big concrete wall at the end of the run way 🧐","80: My heart goes out to those left behind...to pick up the pieces...people like Mr Jeon Je-Young...to lose anyone close to you in such circumstances...utterly appalling...","81: the korean pilots are to blame also, they panicked and rushed to land, not even decreasing their speed and momentum when they tried to land at the middle of the runway where they should have known wasn’t a very long runway in the first place. i find it hard to believe a bird strike disabled the landing gear, and even if a flock of birds were sucked into the engine, the engine itself wouldn’t shut down immediately as they are designed to withstand to some extent bird strikes. in short the korean pilots judgement are also to blame. korean pilots have the worst track record in the oecd","82: It's really cruel and can't control my tears😢","83: Jesus! that wall is just ridiculous, nothing survives with a head on collision with a reinforced concrete wall."],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10324"},"video_id":"x4534o_N4Lo","title":"South Korea: Jeju Air plane skidded off runway, killing at least 47 people | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4534o_N4Lo","text":"We begin with breaking news out of South Korea where authorities say at least 47 people are dead after a passenger jet crashed.

The strike evidently did lead to engine failure AND landing gear failure.\n\nFact 3. Thus, the plane did take the go-around. It tried to skidland with its fuselage—which is almost guaranteed to lead to disasters— but they didn't have alternative options.\n\nFact 4. Hence the disaster.\n\nFact 5. The fence is not a primary cause of the crash. It may have worked as a mutiplying factor, but not the main problem.\n\nBelow are but some speculations worth mentioning:\nAs many are pointing out (while it makes sense that the engine broke due to the strike,) it seems quite weird that a few birds were all it took to break the landing gear. Further investigations should and will determine whether the landing gear breakage was an unavoidable result of the strike or an unnecessary bi-product for which Boeing is accountable.\n*Until then, I strongly believe no conspiracy theory is necessary.*","74: boeing?","75: The runway is too short to attempt a belly landing.

Plenty of aviation experts have explained that it should not have been made of concrete and because of the fact that planes can land off the actual runway especially during emergency landings such as this one, the very reason international airports do NOT use concrete barriers like this is BECAUSE IT CAN CAUSE GREAT DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE. 179 out of 181 deaths is appalling and 100% preventable. Those who think this was just a fated accident need to do more research and understand why it is common sense CONCRETE WALLS are NOT supposed to be built around the end of a runway PERIOD.","77: What an amazing video, well done with your analysis.  Do we have footage of the first attempt at landing?  Was the landing gear down then?  Any view of the bird strike?  Is there no equipment that tells them which engine is off and no alerts to stop them turning off the wrong engine?  When will we hear from the black box, I understand they were badly damaged?  Why did the plane explode?  I would expect planes to carry 10% over the fuel they need for a journey.  I guess that is enough for such a fireball.  Did they land at the start of the southbound runway or half way down it?  Given they had no landing gear I considered whether they would have stopped more quickly on the grass.  what are the training standards for landing without landing gear?  Is it not possible for planes to emit a noise or something that frightens birds?  Clapping my hands scares birds in my garden.  Thanks.","78: I would have piloted that berm like I was riding a CR250.

I can get a quick, excellent analysis here or get next to nothing watching the useless news. Or wait months for the report to come out. This is the first time somone explained the barriers at the end of the runway and how they may have prevented a much higher death toll had the jetliner crashed into a populated area. This video may be a lot of speculation but at least it makes me think of the possibilities.","94: The pilot flew into a wall.. what a lousy pilot","95: He is INCORRECT  on one key fact. Hydraulic power to lower the gear is still available even if BOTH engines are shut down.  The plane needs hydraulic power to control the ailerons, rudder, and elevators and the plane was able to fly down to landing. This proves that it had hydraulic power. The pilot just forget to lower the gear in their rush to land.","96: The pilot made a great emergency landind, the problem was that there was no landind track until the safe stop","97: They landed way too late, leaving no runway for themselves, and came in way too fast, exacerbating the “ground effect” that kept them from touching down for a while. Has they kept close to stalling speed and below 3 degree standard glide-slope, they would have landed at a much slower speed and had enough runway left to deal with ground effect and then braking. Another example of poor training because the ILS system does all the work for pilots these days and they almost never have to land the plane on their own, so they never get practice. Let’s not forget about that wall at the end of the runway, that should have never been made out of concrete. The only reason I can think they made that wall out of concrete is to protect the road thats behind the airport from aircraft that may over-run the runway.","98: Why was the Arrester Barrier not present at the runway end?","99: 人災か😢"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10327"},"video_id":"XzBKCt8-uWg","title":"New Video of JeJu 2216 - The sequence of events","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzBKCt8-uWg","text":"This incident has been confirmed as a passenger issue and not related to this crash. The flight started at an airport near Bangkok in Thailand and ended here at Muan in South Korea according to all reports. The flight was completely uneventful until this accident. The plane involved was a Boeing 737-800 that originally flew in 2009 and flew through Ryan Air until 2017 when it was delivered to Guu Air. This airport has a high incidence of bird strikes, and even has Bird Activity Areas listed on its charts. For the accident sequence: At approximately 8:54 AM, the plane attempted its first landing on Runway 1 (the way going almost straight north). The crew aborted the Landing, performing a go-around maneuver. Three minutes later at 8:57 AM, the crew was warned of Bird activity in the area. One minute later, the plane declared an emergency. Six minutes later at 9:03 AM, the plane attempted an emergency landing on Runway 1 (the southbound runway), completely opposite to the one they just attempted to land on. Here, the aircraft overran the runway and crashed into a wall at the end. Next is an analysis of this clip. While you're up looking at the plane, I'm looking at the ground. Note the glass banisters, the location of the shadows, and the mountains in the background. We know the accident happened at 9:00 AM; if we set all our conditions right, we can figure out exactly where this footage was taken from. The shadows tell us that the view faces south, and these mountains look very much like the ones south of the runway. That means the footage was most likely taken from this building, which was built after 2015 when the latest street view images were taken. This incident happened during the first approach and likely caused the go-around. We can also figure out how fast the plane is going by analyzing the video. We can count approximately 44 frames between the plane reaching the end of the threshold and the end of the pavement, which is approximately 1.46 seconds on this 30 frames per second video. Note that we use the shadow because it's not subject to perspective changes.","comments":["0: I can’t believe this needs to be said, but comments made in bad faith will be removed.

Hydraulic power to lower the gear is still available even if BOTH engines are shut down.

The pilot just forget to lower the gear in their rush to land.","96: The pilot made a great emergency landind, the problem was that there was no landind track until the safe stop","97: They landed way too late, leaving no runway for themselves, and came in way too fast, exacerbating the “ground effect” that kept them from touching down for a while. Has they kept close to stalling speed and below 3 degree standard glide-slope, they would have landed at a much slower speed and had enough runway left to deal with ground effect and then braking. Another example of poor training because the ILS system does all the work for pilots these days and they almost never have to land the plane on their own, so they never get practice. Let’s not forget about that wall at the end of the runway, that should have never been made out of concrete. The only reason I can think they made that wall out of concrete is to protect the road thats behind the airport from aircraft that may over-run the runway.","98: Why was the Arrester Barrier not present at the runway end?","99: 人災か😢"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10328"},"video_id":"XzBKCt8-uWg","title":"New Video of JeJu 2216 - The sequence of events","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzBKCt8-uWg","text":"We can measure the distance between the threshold and see it's 1214 meters; that means the plane is traveling at 82.8 knots or 160 nautical miles per hour (NMH). Why was there no landing gear and flaps during a go-around? One of the first steps a pilot performs is to retract the landing gear and start retracting the flaps, which reduces drag and helps the plane climb faster during an engine failure. It's possible that during this emergency in this critical flight, the pilots accidentally shut down the wrong engine; one that was still working. In 2017, a flight from Delhi to Mumbai had the pilot shut down the wrong engine during an engine failure. If both engines were shut down, both hydraulic pumps would be shut off and there'd be no power for the backup electric pumps. However, the Boeing 737 has a backup system: A set of levers that will drop the landing gear using gravity alone. Unfortunately, these levers are not in an ergonomic position; faced with losing altitude and airspeed, the crew may just not have been able to reach those levers in time. But why is there a wall at the end of the runway? The wall is used to elevate the ILS approach system, keeping those antennas off the ground. This makes the system much more reliable and helps planes land in very poor weather. However, these walls can also be used to protect people and property around the airport. Just beyond that wall are several buildings, including vacation hotels. While it made the accident look much more dramatic, it may have been responsible for saving many more lives. The black boxes have already been recovered, and the NTSB has been tasked with working on this case. We'll have more details in the coming months.","comments":["0: I can’t believe this needs to be said, but comments made in bad faith will be removed.

First, I agree, the pilots likely made errors. This was a horrible situation. BUT.. the dirt and concrete bank at the end DEFINITELY caused more fatalities than there would have otherwise been. My point is simply that airports should do their due diligence in speed pits and breakaway antennas and avoid unnecessary death walls. That’s it! End of discussion. It was disturbing to see a plane disintegrate into a stack of antennas when it could cave come to a stop a few hundred yards later without hitting any other buildings.

It seems like, although government officials say they are looking into what caused this morning's crash, many officials here now believe it was because of birds. The Transport Ministry has confirmed that before the crash, apparently, the plane had been warned about birds around the area. About one minute after receiving the warning, a distress call (Mayday) was sent out by the pilot. Five minutes later, the plane crashed. Earlier, there were bags containing dead bodies here; they have all been taken away now. The tail of the plane is still visible, as it was when it crashed into that outer wall of the runway. Earlier, efforts to lift the wreckage had been made but seem to have given up on that. They are trying to see if more bodies are under the plane's tail. So far, we know this Airline and its airplane were supposed to land at one international airport at 8:30 a.m. This morning, while descending toward the airport, the plane apparently collided with a flock of birds at an altitude of about 200 feet. According to some reports citing officials, it struck the right wing in the engine. The crew aborted the landing and raised the nose of the aircraft, likely thinking that landing was not possible. The control tower received the distress call, and this plane just went around the airport, trying to land for a second time. However, by then, apparently, the engine had caught fire. We are also getting reports that he did attempt to try and land the second time around but was not successful. There seems to be more evidence coming out that birds were one of the causes of this crash because there was a message sent by one passenger who was on that plane to a friend here on the ground, according to that message, it said: \"A bird got stuck in the wind and we're unable to land.\" That was the last message the passengers sent before this crash happened. Earlier, I was also inside Muan International Airport where relatives and family members were waiting for any kind of information they could get about their loved ones.","comments":["0: This would never happen in that singapore","1: Possible the cockpitcrew manually shut down the wrong, well functioning engine after the birdstrike and fire in the right engine.

If they had extended the flaps and landing gear manually, that takes several minutes actually, meaning that one of the pilots has to get up & manually let the gear & flaps down. It looks like they just didnt have enough time, when you have to make an emergency landing due to engine fire, you cant stay in the air, you have to land immediately, the flaps and landing gear would have kept them at a higher altitude, which is the opposite of what they need because they need to land fast, not slowly, that engine fire could have spreaded in the air as well.","93: BOEING again!

Emergency landing procedures were initiated; a passenger's final messages indicated the plane struck a bird and the pilot declared an emergency. However, further details are unclear. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but several contributing factors are being examined: the potential impact of the bird strike on the plane’s engine, the failure of the landing gear to deploy, and a concrete barrier that the plane hit upon landing, which significantly contributed to the high death toll. Experts have criticized the design of the airport's runway area, noting that such barriers are not typically placed so close to runways due to the risk of severe damage during an accident. The Boeing 737-800, despite being involved in this crash, has a strong safety record overall, and the investigation will focus on whether any technical issues with the plane or pilot error were to blame. In addition to the National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing, South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board is working with support from the US to analyze flight data and voice recorders to uncover more details as the investigation continues. Experts caution against jumping to conclusions and emphasize the need for thorough analysis to determine the exact causes of the crash. It is expected that a preliminary report will be released within 30 days, with a final report following within a year. Meanwhile, Airlines and aviation officials are reviewing safety protocols but stress that air travel remains statistically very safe.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d1032c"},"video_id":"_7aVKPtTqG8","title":"JEJU Air Flight 2216: Is it a bird strike or a maintenance Failure??","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aVKPtTqG8","text":"This is the sad story of JuJu Air flight 2216 at 9:03 in the morning.

We've been exploring the tragic incident involving an aircraft that had to perform a belly landing due to bird strike, which led to severe damage and injuries. Our guests have provided valuable insights into this unfortunate event. Firstly, we heard from [user]. They emphasized the importance of thorough training for pilots in handling emergency situations like a belly landing. They also highlighted the significance of having adequate fuel reserves during such maneuvers to ensure safe landings. Additionally, they mentioned that more effective safety methodologies should be practiced while enforcing these procedures. Next, we had [user] share their perspective on the matter. They pointed out that modern aircraft designs come with certain limitations when it comes to handling emergencies like a belly landing. The absence of traditional brakes and the reliance on flaps for drag generation can lead to uncontrolled scenarios if not managed properly. They also stressed the need for better early warning systems to prevent such incidents from happening in the first place. Lastly, we had [user] share their thoughts. They acknowledged that while human error cannot be completely eliminated, there is always room for improvement through rigorous training and enhanced methodologies. They emphasized the importance of following checklists and procedures meticulously during emergency situations like a belly landing. Thank you to all our guests for sharing your expertise with us today.","comments":["0: Here control room should have informed about bird activity atleast 30 min before plane landing time \n\nYes looks like, Pilots made rush / rash decision \n\nPilots should have made few rounds, off loaded fuel, and then  land, etc \n\nCan Boeing or Airbus think of placing some kind of mesh wherein large birds can’t enter into turbine  blades? Just a suggestion, if it is technically feasible. \n\nAs it is a belly landing, pilots could have thought of landing in a nearby water bodies or wet lands (just like Indian Airlines flight belly landing in paddy fields in Nov 1993 near Tirupati. The then pilot Mr Bhalla got huge accolades for saving number of Telugu film stars Incl Chiranjeevi, Balakrishna, Vijayashanti etc )","1: I think it is the very wrongful decision by the pilot to plane belly land without the landing gears is very disastrous because of the very heavy impact landing, and perhaps the passengers sitting at mid section especially in plane belly section could have died instantly because the great impact and shock!

See The Engines After The Crash, Plus More.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxymMEgQIE","text":"You are watching Maximus Aviation. Greetings, everyone. Maximus here in the wee hours of the morning of January 6 on the west coast in California, US. I was just watching the news out of South Korea on the Guu Air flight 2216 and I saw something that caught my eye; something that may or may not have caught your eye yet. I don't know but South Korea is saying that as of this week (probably today, tomorrow) they're going to get the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder information back to South Korea so they can determine what caused the crash. We don't know if it was pilot error, we don't know if it was plane error; we definitely know was the giant bunker at the end of the runway that ultimately was responsible. In this news broadcast I was watching from South Korea on MBC News, something caught my eye and I thought I'd share it with you. So, we're going to talk about it okay. As we already know, on December 29 at around 8:54 a.m., flight 2216 from Bangkok was cleared to land on Runway One at Moon Airport in South Korea. At that point everything seemed to be going smoothly. Three minutes later, the control tower issued a standard advisory warning about Bird activity in the area; it wasn't an alert or emergency but just a routine precaution. The air traffic controller warned the pilot to watch for Birds crossing his approach and pass well. The pilot came in for a landing, aborted the landing due to the bird strike warning. Shortly after that, we've all seen that famous video of sparks coming out of the right engine on the aircraft taken from some bystanders on the ground; they said they heard loud pops and booms along with the flames coming out of the right engine. We don't see any damage to that engine or anything like a blade being expelled through the cowling. Any damage it could have happened if you remember the Southwest Airlines 737 where one poor passenger was killed in the process; there was a lot of damage to the cowling, but we can't see it that doesn't mean that it didn't happen. However, on the ground they did see and hear the noise. So, at that point, unexpectedly, the pilot suddenly radioed in, made no conclusions about the pilots but definitely wondered if any of you out there had any ideas; let's talk about it down in the comment section. That leads me to my second thought in this specific portion of video here: many have wondered if smoke had filled the cockpit that had been a recent problem with the Max and also some of the older 737s where oil leaking from one engine was funneled into the cabin and the cockpit, and they were getting smoke. But if you look at this image, the glass windscreen is very clear; you can see the pilots bracing for impact right through to the other side. So, is there smoke in the cockpit? I don't think so but then again, we don't know for sure and we will know for sure. So, something I was doing in the middle of the night watching the news out of South Korea doesn't everybody do that? I saw these images and I thought I'd show them with you.","comments":["0: It’s full of birds\nGuy they are both full of bird 🦜 gelato","1: S Korean deleted the data before sending to NTSB,,,","2: Two observations:\n1. Wouldn't Engine #1 still be windmilling rapidly due to speed of aircraft?\n2. It appears that Engine #2's cowling is open to me. The profile of it looks different from Engine #1 as it comes in to touchdown. It also looks like an open cowling and not a reverser to me as well.","3: Exhaust was clearly from the right engine, not the left.  There is no sign of life in that left engine when landing.","4: If you freeze the video it´s possible to see the radome severely damaged due bird-strike. The deadliest bird-strike aircraft accident. CVR \"frozen\" to public scrutinize so far after been already transcript. Hummm and it makes me wonder!!!!","5: If you do a U turn on to the reciprocal runway by doing a right turn, your right engine would be running and good. NO pilot of a twin ever turns into a dead engine! So, the left must have been shutdown, even though the right was the one clearly ingesting birds! Saying that, should have continued the original approach, it was far more stable, configured and established ... even with the distraction of a bird strike!","6: Loved the soothing  relaxing  sound of your voice  sounds a little like the late art bell.😊😊😊😊😊","7: This guy doesn't know his left from his right.","8: cool glasses mate","9: Bird strike, pilots lost situational awareness smart move would have been to continue the inital landing.  They initiated a go around, alarms going off lights flashing, pilots have no clue what checklist or memory items to complete.  CFM starts to breakdown, CPT or FO shutdown the wrong engine.  Now they have to get down like NOW!  They come in hot, no flaps, no landing gear completely behind the aircraft.  Even with all the mistakes had a chance but someone thought it was a good idea to build a brick wall to attach ILS antenna, SMH.  Plane didn't slow down for entire length of runway that was still available to land stayed at around 165 knots, strange.","10: One crucial aspect, for me, was that they rammed straight into the wall. They most  have been fighting some issue inside that prevented them from looking out the windshield, believing they still could recover. They would have instinctively snatched the wheel upon approaching the wall.","11: One thing for sure is there must have been flight crew incompetence. 😢","12: I think what we are looking at is the inlet guide vanes for the compressor section not the fan blades.  The IGVs do not rotate.","13: Gentlemen pilots, someone has to tell you this. You are NOT pilots anymore, you are irresponsible people who have the LIVES of 200 people in your hands instead of piloting a plane.......... for 30 minutes!!!!!!!!! you read the landing instructions!!!!!! (checklists) because without it you can't press 5 buttons and move 3 levers??!! Fundamental question. Are pilots flying with us?  \nWe do not entrust our lives to secretaries and lectors who need half an hour to turn over 100 sheets of paper and do it 10 times a day. And please don't tell me that a passenger plane is a very complicated machine. There are rockets (E. Musk) that take off without pilots, fly to the target, come back and land ALONE. One guy sits somewhere in the basement and runs it, telling the machine what to do. We are in the 21st century, we can do it. OK, I understand that whoever it is has to learn this at the beginning. That's what simulators and career ladders are for.  \nPilots are VERY poorly trained and cannot make decisions on their own because they MUST read a book to land every time they have to do so. This is an abnormal situation. You have become crazy manual readers over the last 30 years.\n\nThis is not visible in the attached amateur video. But... NO actions related to the landing procedure were taken (because they didn't have time to read it!!!).  \nThis is ONLY possible in the event of a power outage. Power in this type of aircraft is generated by engines. As a result of the failure of one, the other one takes over the functions. Failure of both engines at the same time happens once in 1 million times, which means it practically does not happen. (In this case, one engine was working.)   \nThe last such a well-known case was just such a situation and landing on the Hudson River one frosty morning in January 2009. The pilot, Captain Sully, landed safely and only ditched because he DID NOT READ AND FOLLOW the reading procedure. He knew what he had to do and he did it. Two years later, a pilot from my country did exactly what the pilot of flight 2216 SHOULD have done. On YouTube, the title of this material is 'Boeing 767 Emergency Landing Warsaw 2011'\nCHAOS and panic in the cabin. What a decision is... is not executed or made a mistake. NIGHTMARE. I will ask again... \"Did a pilot fly with us?\"\n\nRegarding ILS. Exactly the same ILS, raised above ground level and built up in the same way as on runway 010 of this airport... it is located on the other side of runway 190. Moreover, I took the trouble to check other airports, e.g. JeJu's home airport. It's exactly the same there. And at many other airports around the world. The Korean press at the time of the reconstruction of these ILSs justified this reconstruction. Previous structures were carried away by a typhoon and landed at the bottom of a nearby sea bay. The whole secret. \n\nAnd one last thing. Of course, any family of a driver going 120 mph into a roadside tree will be asking... \"why was that tree THERE?\" The ILS embankment on MWX is 840 feet/255 meters from the end of R19. In any case, given the speed of the belly landing, they weren't going to stop quickly. There was NO option and the pilots knew it. The 1,600 m that the plane covered while sliding along the runway in an uncontrolled and inert manner, it covered at an average speed of 290 km/h!!! He touched down at a speed of approx. 360km/h!!! that is 100 km/h too MUCH.  \nIf there was no ILS embankment there, the plane would have crashed into a solid airport fence (2 m below the runway level) and then would have been on the highway and fallen off the embankment on which the highway is located. (next 5 m below the belt level). CATASTROPHE.\n\nps.\nTwo days earlier from the day of the disaster, on Friday, exactly the same plane was on a flight to Beijing and was EMERGENCY reversed halfway back to the airport in Korea. In this unlucky flight, the crew was inexperienced (captain 6800 hours and pilot 1650 hours) recruited from the armed forces and there was a high probability of MCR occurrence. \nThis has already happened among Far Eastern crews. Black boxes damaged (FVR) .........although they were located in the detached and NOT damaged in any way tail part of the aircraft. The same one in which the only two people who survived the disaster survived.\n\n(sorry for language errors, translated by a translator)","14: There are 5 different videos online of this unlucky landing, taken from 5 different places and cameras. In the place where there is a wall and an ILS installation, there is the same ILS on the opposite side of this lane. The Google map does not reflect the actual situation today. It is old from the period of the airport expansion. The airport and the surrounding area are one large construction site. Google Maps from the road level (not from a bird's eye view) shows better what and where, and at what levels it is located from the airport level.\nInterrupting the approach at 01, the aircraft moved to the LEFT. on 'West' . There are mountains on the right, he couldn't choose that direction.\n\nQuestion . What does the GA (go-around) procedure mean? Does it mean landing on the SAME runway that was initially selected and configured... or landing on a different runway? !!! I guess it's the former after all.\nThe GA procedure was not performed. The pilots were running completely amok. Like students in a gliding school after their first lesson. Chaos, panic and failure to follow procedures. They actually reported a GA go-around to the tower.......but they didn't do it.\nFrom ADS records etc. the sequence of events follows:\n\n1. 8:54  ATC clears landing, runway 01 (altitude 1600ft, speed 260km/h, course 4 degrees. \n2.  8:57  ATC warns about birds (altitude 1100ft, speed 250km/h, heading 356 degrees)\n3.  8:58:13  crew reports Mayday, Bird Strike!! (height 550ft, speed 280km/h - the plane suddenly changes course by 8 degrees to the right and in 2 seconds lowers the flight by approximately 50m. A second later it is another 50m lower. In other words, it suddenly dives at an altitude of 350m above the terrain and finally is at 160m !! People, what kind of pilot performs such maneuvers while flying a slow elephant ---> 737 and behaves like a cowboy on fast horse ---> F16 and dodges like an incoming AIM-9 Sidewinder. Answer -----> military.\n4.  8:58:21  (height 450ft, speed 290km/h are 200ft too low!\n5.  8:58:24  (altitude 400ft, speed 290km/h) GA report, go-around.        \n6.  8:58:28  (altitude 650ft, speed 280km/h) another evasive maneuver to the right, then turn left towards West.\n7. 8:58:50  (the pilot interrupted the GA procedure... which he did not actually start) the pilot's decision to abandon the GA route and land on runway 01, and HERE the ADS-B recording ends.   \n  \n\n8.  9:00  (the machine has not been configured for the new approach path) captain's request to land on runway 19, the tower agrees! \n9.  9:01  (the pilot started the turn too early and after reaching the straight he saw that he was too high and was flying too fast! ) tight turn to the right to 19, the pilot did not see the runway during the maneuver.     \n10  9:02  touchdown at 1200 m from the runway threshold, attempted landing on the 2800 m runway. \n                       (1600m to the end of the runway. He touched down at a speed of approximately 360km/h!! that is, 100km/h too MUCH. He traveled 1600m to the moment of impact at an average speed of approximately 290km/h).\n\nAfter an aborted approach from direction 01, the pilots do not change anything during the approach from direction 19. They do not move far enough to re-enter the path at the correct height and speed. They did NOT reconfigure the plane for the new procedure. Once above the runway, they glide over it for approximately 1,200 m at a height of 1-5 m, almost touching the runway several times, and then the plane finally touches down, sits on the runway like a sled, and glides completely inertly on the concrete, in no way losing speed, direction or momentum.\n\n\n(sorry for language errors, translated by a translator)","15: Now that sounds like improper pilot training. Pilots need tattoos on their hands! L for left and R for right. Just like in bootcamp the  TI would give the command column left and when the column moved right he would yell “ your other left dummies “!","16: Let’s wait for the data instead of automatically blaming the pilots","17: I can see the thrust reversers were deployed as you can see from the video.  It is the Cascade version thrust reverser most likely build by Goodrich (now known as RTX Corporation).  However, why were the flaps and airbrakes not activated?  The thrust reverser can slow it down as can be seen, but unfortunately there is a concrete structure in front of it.  As for landing gear, it can be lowered manually from the cockpit.  Bird strike does not affect landing gear lowering.  There are a lot of unanswered questions, but, I am clear of one answer - the thrust reversers were indeed deployed and I am specifically sensitive to this because I work on Thrust reversers before.","18: There is only one answer. The both pilots were 100% drunk. They missed the first approach and they panicked in the second approach and rushed. No any other explanation.","19: I do not understand, was it the right engine or the wrong engine. After all there are two.","20: I don't know if it's true, but there were news reports that the Chinese 737 was crashed by the pilot on purpose. I don't think China would want that info out if it was true, but that's the report that is still on Youtube.","21: Too early to know. Let’s allow the investigation proceed","22: You mixed up right and left so many times I can’t follow, next time make the L with your hands","23: Not a jet guy, but I don't get the hurry to shut down so quickly. Lose thrust? Push them both up, figure out who is not helping after the thrust shows up. In a prop plane, the hurry is to get the correct propeller feathered because of the drag of a windmilling prop. That makes sense..... for props. We all train on that, but why stick with it beyond (some) turboprops?","24: Sum Ting Wong","25: There were two pilots. Possibly one of them fumbled in this very stressful situation and made a mistake. The other pilot had no choice but to land the plane soonest possible.","26: After the initial bird strike, the aircraft was configured to land and the pilots should have continued their approach and landed on the available runway. Apparently, the approach was stabilized with landing gear and flaps deployed, which would have slowed down the aircraft after touchdown. Another observation is that they would’ve been going in the opposite direction of the ILS tower that they ended up crashing into when they attempted the belly, landing resulting in a terrible loss of life. My condolences to the families of the victims who perished in the accident.","27: I think your right. the wrong engine was shut down. That kills all electronics and hydraulics. No flaps, no gear, no hope.","28: thank you","29: This reminds me of the Sully in the Hudson River. No engine at all","30: A lot of cranky ATC in JFK tower. On check-in or follow up tower says clear to land Rwy XX, pilot read backs. If pilot provides their location, what approach they are on fine.  The behavior of ATC is cringe. Now you should not get into speech, with details. ATC knows, tower knows you are comming and what runway approach you were given.","31: That plane was still flying under power along the runway, you might hear it too.","32: listen lots going on in a cockpit in a mayday sitation","33: 737 Pilot Reacts to the JeJu 737 Disaster Max Afterburner @ 1:06-1:07 you can clearly see both engines spirit out a plume from both engines.

Thanks.","35: Multiple emergencies in 1: a bird strike resulting in an emergency landing, aborting the landing (for some strange reason), making a subsequent emergency landing after a steep 180 degree turn and mid runway with no landing gears and at rotation speed!! Guys concrete berm or not, this plane was doomed unfortunately...don't you agree?","36: I think we all pretty much figured out they shut  down the wrong engine by now .  The no gear no flaps just about guarantees it .","37: I am just curious, but if no hydraulics due to wrong engine shut down, how could they still have aeleron and elevator control, as they clearly did to line up run way, but no flap, landing gear, or spoiler control?  Just curious.","38: Low testosterone causes panic under high stress situations. Panic causes bad reactions like these. Turning off wrong engine, not turning apu on, not using alt flaps, not using landing gear (not even gravity deployment as the N2 reversor deployed indicates positive hydraulic pressure)","39: it was established very early that the left engine was not running, you can see it in the footage evident to no reverse thrust.  the original theory was they turned the wrong engine off","40: Much better when we did not see you😢","41: Pilots should have to watch that Suzanne Pleshette movie.","42: The Black Box will tell the tale.","43: Total conjecture here… I wish people wouldn’t come out with this unscientific nonsense… the aircraft ran down the runway at high speed on these engine pods, ingesting all sorts of debris and then hit a solid piece of concrete… yet you jump to this conclusion","44: Bit late with your analysis there guy.","45: Amazing neither engine looks like it hit the horizontal or vertical concrete slabs.\nI'd guess they engine pylons detached as the bottom of the engines came up to the start of the slope of earth. The engines were slowed dramatically by the earth bank so that by the time the engines got to where the top horizontal slab would be, the (strongly built) wing centre section had already smashed away that top concrete section, so the engines didn't hit it. (And somehow they also missed the vertical concrete slabs too - probably by luck).\nIt appears that the engines both came to rest in the gap where a section of the localiser top slab has been smashed away. Can't really be sure of that though, from the snippets of video we saw here.","46: Good catch Maximus!!!","47: Creepy looking guy.","48: What he’s calling exhaust from the left engine is the sparks and smoke from scraping on the ground. If you look closely at the right engine you can see the haze that’s indicative of the engine running. So it looks like left was off and right was running at landing.","49: Without that wall they would have made it","50: I’ve been saying to the screen from day one that there were puffs from the left and right engines, also the cabin was obviously not full of smoke! Very strange that the pilot flying didn’t just continue his approach and land as it appears that the plane was fully configured and stabilised even after the bird strike. I also agree with your statement about the damage or lack of to the left engine! It seems that fatigue or poor decision making may have led to the wrong engine being shut down. Be interesting to see the passenger manifest also!","51: Lets hope the pilots did not switch of the wrong engine. I would think even today  the 2nd engine  must have failed for some reason Even if they \n did switch  it off  on realisation  they must have tried to start it but may be it wouldn't start. By then the situation must have been  serious that the option  to land was only available. But if the concrete wall was not present may be lot of souls would have been saved. To me the concrete wall is the main issue  its very existence at the end of runaway is wrong.","52: If anyone has heard the long version of the crash, you can hear the engine spooling down after everything comes to a stop. So I’m confident the engine was running.","53: Left and right dont change because you look at the plane froom the front ...makes things confusing 😮","54: Revenge of the Birds 🦅  !","55: Informative but stop mixing up left and right.\nEngines are referred to as seen from the pilot’s perspective.","56: First Officer along for the ride? Has CRM improved since Guam??? Asian Safe face situation is real, I know this, as I live in SE Asia.","57: If you look, it also appears that only the right thrust reverser was deployed.","58: How do you know they didn't have a bird strike in the left first ? Maybe that sound made the person on the ground to look up and  catch the bird strike on the right engine.  2 engines out they had no hydraulic flaps or landing gear and minimum thrust","59: I am an airline pilot for 25 years and I have watched every available video about this crash.  And it is absolutely amazing how many conclusions and speculations are drawn from the footage. Even those \"aviation-super-expert-check-training-mega-captains\" on YT speculate their butts off about what happened. It is so shameful. Absolutely NOTHING and NO THING can be told right now except the obvious. They landed clean and too fast, touched down too late and  struck that wall. That´s about it. Why it happened and what went wrong? Only and only the investigations will show.","60: It looks like that ILS Plane Shredder was what the US used to test how a plane would break up in test flights.\n\nRIP to the 179 victims and my condolences to the surviving Family and Friends.\n\n❤✝🙏🏻✝⚓","61: Im betting it was a dual engine surge.","62: goofy sunglasses","63: The Muan accident video is CG, and the evidence can be seen by comparing it with existing photos of the same model.

Another thing is that there is writing on the engine cover on a real airplane, but it is not in the accident video. I don't know English, so I translated it with a translator and uploaded it.","64: Engineering have names: #1 and #2.","65: Yes, so maybe the difference between two pilots (and two planes?) is that one can land an A320 on a river with no engines and the other cannot fly a 737-800 on one engine…and when you hear that one asian Airline is ran with 34% of their domestic pilots who haven’t got the required qualifications and certifications, you may wonder…about “differences” 😢 on both planes and crews…I know one pilot instructor who ended his career in the area where he qualified a large portion of trainees as “hopeless” and always “right” when they were doing mistakes and then, are unable to progress that way…so we must be careful but globally (but not a generality across the board)..the early hours flight accidents are due to a critical technical issue and if the material holds up well during many flight hours, at landing time, the accidents have often human errors as one if not the major root cause. Some health issues (and errors) specially on older pilots can also be generated by the much higher stress as landing approaches…that’s why single pilots commuter flights after a certain age of 50-60, should have a backup on board , you cannot rely exclusively on a automatic landing AI almost system, one single glitch not in place and the plain plane salut is gone…That is why each incident must be investigated throughly, otherwise it will always be the dead pilot fault, not to blame the airline or the manufacturer or the trafic control, forcing enormous compensations requests for the victims …","66: 어떤사람들은 이 사건이 조작된것이라고 생각한다.\n비행기 착륙과 사고장면은 그래픽이고 \n 저 콘크리트 뒷편에 불을 질렀다는 추측이다.\n사고현장의 사진은 콘크리트 앞은 깨끗하고 그 뒷편만 흔적이 있다. 여러 사진을 보면 그런 의심이 든다","67: Joining dots from 2 different pages?

What you say the pilots did or did not do, they hit the runway. They should have run off into a field or the water, or a prepared area for runaways.  They should be the heroes now but a design flaw killed them. I know that land is expensive so it would be interesting if this Barrier was to protect  a population area. What led to the forced no choice landing is a curiosity. It will be sad to learn that there was no bird control because of the holiday and back ups at all positions including ATC. It will be 3 contributing factors that led to touch down. IMO the engine was powered but not turning, but trying. IMO The landing gear was not deployed because they knew if they did the speed would not have allowed them to stop. They were coming in hot. The last photo of the co pilot bracing on touch down indicated they were doing what they could and mostly intentional based on circumstance. If it was ICN everyone would have lived.","74: Another YouTuber mentioned this and I'm going to keep posting about it... Why didn't the pilots try to use their rudder to avoid the wall? The rudder was working for landing, but they never tried to use it on the ground. If I saw that wall getting bigger and bigger in my window, I would have stomped on the rudder to try to move the plane away from it. They didn't even try to move the rudder. Did they completely forget how airplanes work? Did they just give up?","75: 6:56 🤣","76: Question: from a pilots perspective, how do you know which engine a bird has hit? Visually? Do you turn your head and look? Or do you go by equipment?","77: They trying to hide human error most likely.","78: Kegworth uk pilot turned the wrong engine \nBlades striped off turbine\nOn running eng, the one on fire ,blades not striped off on good engine as it was not running on impact \nCasues of crash pilot error PIC had his back broken in crash\nPlane hit moterway short of runnway\nAs you see port engine not running blades intact\nStb engine blades striped off so it was burning and turning","79: The China plane crash that occurred a few years ago was revealed to be intentional by one of the pilots. It’s actually covered by a lot of western sources. You can find the coverage on YouTube as well. Let’s not act like democrazies are better at being transparent - the propaganda machine that keeps the population brainwashed, misinformed, ignorant and braindead on the activities of the alphabet organisations in the west is the most active in the world.","80: Such a strange incident which won’t come clear until the CVR and FDR are made public.  They clearly had thrust at the point they’re executed a go-around. They also had hydraulics as they retracted the flaps and gear which both require hydraulic pressure to retract.  Then something happened on the missed approach which caused an immediate return to the airfield.  Perhaps the wrong engine was shutdown. Or perhaps both engines were damaged after the bird strike with at least enough thrust to execute the go-around before losing enough thrust to stay airborne.  I’m concerned about the landing with the landing gear retracted.  The fact that the right engine thrust reversed was deployed on landing indicates they had hydraulic pressure.  In that case, why land with the gear retracted, especially considering they were obviously high and fast based on touching down halfway down the runway?   There are a lot of unanswered questions.  I’m looking forward to the flight data and audio recordings.","81: How long has it been and how much has been said, yet no one seems to have demanded public release of the personal and particularly MEDICAL records of all personnel involved in this case. There have been fatal highway, railway and marine accidents involving individuals who have a record of stroke or heart failure, or who have been subject to an uptake (i.e., injection) of substances that have been known worldwide to have led to \"sudden stress disability.\" If any of the personnel on board or on the ground have wanted to or been required to have such uptakes, now is the time to shake it all out, ask the questions and demand the full answers. Nobody wants that, though, because it would mean fixing legal responsibility. Those with vested interests here are just like the White Star Line being desperate to attribute the sinking of the \"unsinkable\" Titanic on striking an iceberg, which was supposedly an \"act of God.\" Hence the kneejerk reaction this time, rushing like crazy to blame the birds.","82: Based on photos I've seen from other plane crashes, it looks like the right engine was running and sucked in debris.  The left engine does not look like it was running.  The theory that they shut down the wrong engine seems to be supported by these photos.  I hope the cockpit voice recorder reveals why they did not continue their original landing.  It seemed they would want to get the plane on the ground as quickly as possible.","83: Flying in an airliner is always a risk that the pilots may not know what to do and panic themselves.\n\nThings can go wrong fast and suddenly and the machine may be heading for the ground...the pilots may be trying this and trying that and nothing works....but one thing is always working and it's called gravity.\n\nThen those poor people are sitting in an aluminum tube out of control.....yes you are at great risk...I don't care what they say \"oh it's safer than driving to the store in your car\".....maybe so but at least you are on the ground.\n\nPilots can't know everything...and if something suddenly goes wrong, they panic themselves.... people ask why did they rush to land?\n\nThey forgot to put down the landing gear and flaps....in a panic you forget even your name....","84: It appears that they were configured for landing and were able to land instead of go around and during that process it is possible that they raised the flaps, the landing gear and it is very likely that in that short time, they turned off or reduced power in the good engine.\nIt's hard to tell at a glance whether those motors were working or not, the rest is speculation, but in my opinion both motors were spinning; one looks like it lost a blade, but that could have been from the impact with the wall, but the rest of the blades look flattened, this is consistent with a spinning blades. The same goes for the other motor, which didn't lose any blades from a possible bird strike or collision with the wall, but all of its blades look flattened or changed angle, which is a sign that the blades were spinning at the time of impact.","85: Why did they land so late down the runway?\n\nWas there conversation between the pilots and the tower?\n\nDidn't either the pilots or the tower realize there was a cement wall at the end of the runway?\n\nPilots and the tower are usually in constant communication.\n\nFrom the view of the pilots getting ready for impact, it didn't look like there was smoke in the cockpit.","86: G'day,\n\nThe Left Engine 's # 1 Fan Array appears to have incurred \"Blunt Force Trauma\", from having been filled with Dirt, on impact - while NOT being twisted by the Shaft from the Turbines....\n\nWhereas the Right Engine, tge one which was seen to ingest Birds, and to have ejected bits of Cowling  outboard in the process..., and which was seen to have been blowing Hot Air while on Approach before touchdown, and clearly had it's Thrust-Reverse Doors deployed during the Belly-skid....; \nThat Engine's # 1 Bypass Fan looked as if it had been \nAugered into the bottom of the 45° inclined Earth Ramp, chewing the dirt away from the Vertical Pillar-Walls...\n (which were REQUIRED to have been built into the Structure, due to the Typhoon/Flood-Resistance Requirements of the South Korean Government....

Lackadaisical delivery. A big skip","88: Occums razor says that all other explanations non-withstanding the simplest explanation is probably the truth, which means they probably shut off the wrong engine or both losing hydraulic power to lower gear, flaps, etc.","89: Looking at these photos, it reinforces my admiration for the NTSB's amazing talents. How they can ever figure out when damage occurred in a pile of wreckage is beyond me. Personally, it is one of my most admired professions.","90: Point of order - we never say \"left or right\" engine - it's always number 1 or number 2 engine.  If you're gonna make aviation videos you need to get your terminology right.  Other than that I agree with your assessment that they shut down the operating engine in a panic.  There is an old saying in aviation that the first thing you do in an emergency is wind your watch - in other words no hasty actions.","91: Sir, the left engine appears to be shut down in error","92: 5:10 It looks like the main cabin runway contact kicks up white trails.

Accidents should be avoided.. This is one of the things  that can be said now. Wait for the facts of the investigation","99: The reverse thruster was not active on the left engine during landing.

NO pilot of a twin ever turns into a dead engine! So, the left must have been shutdown, even though the right was the one clearly ingesting birds! Saying that, should have continued the original approach, it was far more stable, configured and established ... even with the distraction of a bird strike!","6: Loved the soothing  relaxing  sound of your voice  sounds a little like the late art bell.😊😊😊😊😊","7: This guy doesn't know his left from his right.","8: cool glasses mate","9: Bird strike, pilots lost situational awareness smart move would have been to continue the inital landing.  They initiated a go around, alarms going off lights flashing, pilots have no clue what checklist or memory items to complete.  CFM starts to breakdown, CPT or FO shutdown the wrong engine.  Now they have to get down like NOW!  They come in hot, no flaps, no landing gear completely behind the aircraft.

You are NOT pilots anymore, you are irresponsible people who have the LIVES of 200 people in your hands instead of piloting a plane.......... for 30 minutes!!!!!!!!! you read the landing instructions!!!!!! (checklists) because without it you can't press 5 buttons and move 3 levers??!! Fundamental question. Are pilots flying with us?  \nWe do not entrust our lives to secretaries and lectors who need half an hour to turn over 100 sheets of paper and do it 10 times a day. And please don't tell me that a passenger plane is a very complicated machine. There are rockets (E. Musk) that take off without pilots, fly to the target, come back and land ALONE. One guy sits somewhere in the basement and runs it, telling the machine what to do. We are in the 21st century, we can do it. OK, I understand that whoever it is has to learn this at the beginning. That's what simulators and career ladders are for.  \nPilots are VERY poorly trained and cannot make decisions on their own because they MUST read a book to land every time they have to do so. This is an abnormal situation. You have become crazy manual readers over the last 30 years.\n\nThis is not visible in the attached amateur video. But... NO actions related to the landing procedure were taken (because they didn't have time to read it!!!).  \nThis is ONLY possible in the event of a power outage. Power in this type of aircraft is generated by engines. As a result of the failure of one, the other one takes over the functions. Failure of both engines at the same time happens once in 1 million times, which means it practically does not happen. (In this case, one engine was working.)   \nThe last such a well-known case was just such a situation and landing on the Hudson River one frosty morning in January 2009. The pilot, Captain Sully, landed safely and only ditched because he DID NOT READ AND FOLLOW the reading procedure. He knew what he had to do and he did it. Two years later, a pilot from my country did exactly what the pilot of flight 2216 SHOULD have done. On YouTube, the title of this material is 'Boeing 767 Emergency Landing Warsaw 2011'\nCHAOS and panic in the cabin. What a decision is... is not executed or made a mistake. NIGHTMARE. I will ask again... \"Did a pilot fly with us?\"\n\nRegarding ILS. Exactly the same ILS, raised above ground level and built up in the same way as on runway 010 of this airport... it is located on the other side of runway 190. Moreover, I took the trouble to check other airports, e.g. JeJu's home airport. It's exactly the same there. And at many other airports around the world. The Korean press at the time of the reconstruction of these ILSs justified this reconstruction. Previous structures were carried away by a typhoon and landed at the bottom of a nearby sea bay. The whole secret. \n\nAnd one last thing. Of course, any family of a driver going 120 mph into a roadside tree will be asking... \"why was that tree THERE?\" The ILS embankment on MWX is 840 feet/255 meters from the end of R19. In any case, given the speed of the belly landing, they weren't going to stop quickly. There was NO option and the pilots knew it. The 1,600 m that the plane covered while sliding along the runway in an uncontrolled and inert manner, it covered at an average speed of 290 km/h!!! He touched down at a speed of approx. 360km/h!!! that is 100 km/h too MUCH.  \nIf there was no ILS embankment there, the plane would have crashed into a solid airport fence (2 m below the runway level) and then would have been on the highway and fallen off the embankment on which the highway is located. (next 5 m below the belt level). CATASTROPHE.\n\nps.\nTwo days earlier from the day of the disaster, on Friday, exactly the same plane was on a flight to Beijing and was EMERGENCY reversed halfway back to the airport in Korea. In this unlucky flight, the crew was inexperienced (captain 6800 hours and pilot 1650 hours) recruited from the armed forces and there was a high probability of MCR occurrence. \nThis has already happened among Far Eastern crews. Black boxes damaged (FVR) .........although they were located in the detached and NOT damaged in any way tail part of the aircraft. The same one in which the only two people who survived the disaster survived.\n\n(sorry for language errors, translated by a translator)","14: There are 5 different videos online of this unlucky landing, taken from 5 different places and cameras. In the place where there is a wall and an ILS installation, there is the same ILS on the opposite side of this lane. The Google map does not reflect the actual situation today. It is old from the period of the airport expansion. The airport and the surrounding area are one large construction site. Google Maps from the road level (not from a bird's eye view) shows better what and where, and at what levels it is located from the airport level.\nInterrupting the approach at 01, the aircraft moved to the LEFT. on 'West' . There are mountains on the right, he couldn't choose that direction.\n\nQuestion . What does the GA (go-around) procedure mean? Does it mean landing on the SAME runway that was initially selected and configured... or landing on a different runway? !!! I guess it's the former after all.\nThe GA procedure was not performed. The pilots were running completely amok. Like students in a gliding school after their first lesson. Chaos, panic and failure to follow procedures. They actually reported a GA go-around to the tower.......but they didn't do it.\nFrom ADS records etc. the sequence of events follows:\n\n1. 8:54  ATC clears landing, runway 01 (altitude 1600ft, speed 260km/h, course 4 degrees. \n2.  8:57  ATC warns about birds (altitude 1100ft, speed 250km/h, heading 356 degrees)\n3.  8:58:13  crew reports Mayday, Bird Strike!! (height 550ft, speed 280km/h - the plane suddenly changes course by 8 degrees to the right and in 2 seconds lowers the flight by approximately 50m. A second later it is another 50m lower. In other words, it suddenly dives at an altitude of 350m above the terrain and finally is at 160m !! People, what kind of pilot performs such maneuvers while flying a slow elephant ---> 737 and behaves like a cowboy on fast horse ---> F16 and dodges like an incoming AIM-9 Sidewinder. Answer -----> military.\n4.  8:58:21  (height 450ft, speed 290km/h are 200ft too low!\n5.  8:58:24  (altitude 400ft, speed 290km/h) GA report, go-around.        \n6.  8:58:28  (altitude 650ft, speed 280km/h) another evasive maneuver to the right, then turn left towards West.\n7. 8:58:50  (the pilot interrupted the GA procedure... which he did not actually start) the pilot's decision to abandon the GA route and land on runway 01, and HERE the ADS-B recording ends.   \n  \n\n8.  9:00  (the machine has not been configured for the new approach path) captain's request to land on runway 19, the tower agrees! \n9.  9:01  (the pilot started the turn too early and after reaching the straight he saw that he was too high and was flying too fast! ) tight turn to the right to 19, the pilot did not see the runway during the maneuver.     \n10  9:02  touchdown at 1200 m from the runway threshold, attempted landing on the 2800 m runway. \n                       (1600m to the end of the runway. He touched down at a speed of approximately 360km/h!! that is, 100km/h too MUCH. He traveled 1600m to the moment of impact at an average speed of approximately 290km/h).\n\nAfter an aborted approach from direction 01, the pilots do not change anything during the approach from direction 19. They do not move far enough to re-enter the path at the correct height and speed. They did NOT reconfigure the plane for the new procedure. Once above the runway, they glide over it for approximately 1,200 m at a height of 1-5 m, almost touching the runway several times, and then the plane finally touches down, sits on the runway like a sled, and glides completely inertly on the concrete, in no way losing speed, direction or momentum.\n\n\n(sorry for language errors, translated by a translator)","15: Now that sounds like improper pilot training. Pilots need tattoos on their hands! L for left and R for right. Just like in bootcamp the  TI would give the command column left and when the column moved right he would yell “ your other left dummies “!","16: Let’s wait for the data instead of automatically blaming the pilots","17: I can see the thrust reversers were deployed as you can see from the video.  It is the Cascade version thrust reverser most likely build by Goodrich (now known as RTX Corporation).  However, why were the flaps and airbrakes not activated?  The thrust reverser can slow it down as can be seen, but unfortunately there is a concrete structure in front of it.  As for landing gear, it can be lowered manually from the cockpit.  Bird strike does not affect landing gear lowering.  There are a lot of unanswered questions, but, I am clear of one answer - the thrust reversers were indeed deployed and I am specifically sensitive to this because I work on Thrust reversers before.","18: There is only one answer. The both pilots were 100% drunk. They missed the first approach and they panicked in the second approach and rushed. No any other explanation.","19: I do not understand, was it the right engine or the wrong engine. After all there are two.","20: I don't know if it's true, but there were news reports that the Chinese 737 was crashed by the pilot on purpose. I don't think China would want that info out if it was true, but that's the report that is still on Youtube.","21: Too early to know. Let’s allow the investigation proceed","22: You mixed up right and left so many times I can’t follow, next time make the L with your hands","23: Not a jet guy, but I don't get the hurry to shut down so quickly. Lose thrust? Push them both up, figure out who is not helping after the thrust shows up. In a prop plane, the hurry is to get the correct propeller feathered because of the drag of a windmilling prop. That makes sense..... for props. We all train on that, but why stick with it beyond (some) turboprops?","24: Sum Ting Wong","25: There were two pilots. Possibly one of them fumbled in this very stressful situation and made a mistake. The other pilot had no choice but to land the plane soonest possible.","26: After the initial bird strike, the aircraft was configured to land and the pilots should have continued their approach and landed on the available runway. Apparently, the approach was stabilized with landing gear and flaps deployed, which would have slowed down the aircraft after touchdown. Another observation is that they would’ve been going in the opposite direction of the ILS tower that they ended up crashing into when they attempted the belly, landing resulting in a terrible loss of life. My condolences to the families of the victims who perished in the accident.","27: I think your right. the wrong engine was shut down. That kills all electronics and hydraulics. No flaps, no gear, no hope.","28: thank you","29: This reminds me of the Sully in the Hudson River. No engine at all","30: A lot of cranky ATC in JFK tower. On check-in or follow up tower says clear to land Rwy XX, pilot read backs. If pilot provides their location, what approach they are on fine.  The behavior of ATC is cringe. Now you should not get into speech, with details. ATC knows, tower knows you are comming and what runway approach you were given.","31: That plane was still flying under power along the runway, you might hear it too.","32: listen lots going on in a cockpit in a mayday sitation","33: 737 Pilot Reacts to the JeJu 737 Disaster Max Afterburner @ 1:06-1:07 you can clearly see both engines spirit out a plume from both engines. Look on this video for more detail.","34: Very good. Thanks.","35: Multiple emergencies in 1: a bird strike resulting in an emergency landing, aborting the landing (for some strange reason), making a subsequent emergency landing after a steep 180 degree turn and mid runway with no landing gears and at rotation speed!! Guys concrete berm or not, this plane was doomed unfortunately...don't you agree?","36: I think we all pretty much figured out they shut  down the wrong engine by now .  The no gear no flaps just about guarantees it .","37: I am just curious, but if no hydraulics due to wrong engine shut down, how could they still have aeleron and elevator control, as they clearly did to line up run way, but no flap, landing gear, or spoiler control?  Just curious.","38: Low testosterone causes panic under high stress situations. Panic causes bad reactions like these. Turning off wrong engine, not turning apu on, not using alt flaps, not using landing gear (not even gravity deployment as the N2 reversor deployed indicates positive hydraulic pressure)","39: it was established very early that the left engine was not running, you can see it in the footage evident to no reverse thrust.  the original theory was they turned the wrong engine off","40: Much better when we did not see you😢","41: Pilots should have to watch that Suzanne Pleshette movie.","42: The Black Box will tell the tale.","43: Total conjecture here… I wish people wouldn’t come out with this unscientific nonsense… the aircraft ran down the runway at high speed on these engine pods, ingesting all sorts of debris and then hit a solid piece of concrete… yet you jump to this conclusion","44: Bit late with your analysis there guy.","45: Amazing neither engine looks like it hit the horizontal or vertical concrete slabs.\nI'd guess they engine pylons detached as the bottom of the engines came up to the start of the slope of earth. The engines were slowed dramatically by the earth bank so that by the time the engines got to where the top horizontal slab would be, the (strongly built) wing centre section had already smashed away that top concrete section, so the engines didn't hit it. (And somehow they also missed the vertical concrete slabs too - probably by luck).\nIt appears that the engines both came to rest in the gap where a section of the localiser top slab has been smashed away. Can't really be sure of that though, from the snippets of video we saw here.","46: Good catch Maximus!!!","47: Creepy looking guy.","48: What he’s calling exhaust from the left engine is the sparks and smoke from scraping on the ground. If you look closely at the right engine you can see the haze that’s indicative of the engine running. So it looks like left was off and right was running at landing.","49: Without that wall they would have made it","50: I’ve been saying to the screen from day one that there were puffs from the left and right engines, also the cabin was obviously not full of smoke! Very strange that the pilot flying didn’t just continue his approach and land as it appears that the plane was fully configured and stabilised even after the bird strike. I also agree with your statement about the damage or lack of to the left engine! It seems that fatigue or poor decision making may have led to the wrong engine being shut down. Be interesting to see the passenger manifest also!","51: Lets hope the pilots did not switch of the wrong engine. I would think even today  the 2nd engine  must have failed for some reason Even if they \n did switch  it off  on realisation  they must have tried to start it but may be it wouldn't start. By then the situation must have been  serious that the option  to land was only available. But if the concrete wall was not present may be lot of souls would have been saved. To me the concrete wall is the main issue  its very existence at the end of runaway is wrong.","52: If anyone has heard the long version of the crash, you can hear the engine spooling down after everything comes to a stop. So I’m confident the engine was running.","53: Left and right dont change because you look at the plane froom the front ...makes things confusing 😮","54: Revenge of the Birds 🦅  !","55: Informative but stop mixing up left and right.\nEngines are referred to as seen from the pilot’s perspective.","56: First Officer along for the ride? Has CRM improved since Guam??? Asian Safe face situation is real, I know this, as I live in SE Asia.","57: If you look, it also appears that only the right thrust reverser was deployed.","58: How do you know they didn't have a bird strike in the left first ? Maybe that sound made the person on the ground to look up and  catch the bird strike on the right engine.  2 engines out they had no hydraulic flaps or landing gear and minimum thrust","59: I am an airline pilot for 25 years and I have watched every available video about this crash.  And it is absolutely amazing how many conclusions and speculations are drawn from the footage. Even those \"aviation-super-expert-check-training-mega-captains\" on YT speculate their butts off about what happened. It is so shameful. Absolutely NOTHING and NO THING can be told right now except the obvious. They landed clean and too fast, touched down too late and  struck that wall. That´s about it. Why it happened and what went wrong? Only and only the investigations will show.","60: It looks like that ILS Plane Shredder was what the US used to test how a plane would break up in test flights.\n\nRIP to the 179 victims and my condolences to the surviving Family and Friends.\n\n❤✝🙏🏻✝⚓","61: Im betting it was a dual engine surge.","62: goofy sunglasses","63: The Muan accident video is CG, and the evidence can be seen by comparing it with existing photos of the same model. There is a logo called Jeju Air, which actually has a window, but the accident video shows crude font and the letter r. \r\nIt was drawn incorrectly. I checked it several times. Another thing is that there is writing on the engine cover on a real airplane, but it is not in the accident video. I don't know English, so I translated it with a translator and uploaded it.","64: Engineering have names: #1 and #2.","65: Yes, so maybe the difference between two pilots (and two planes?) is that one can land an A320 on a river with no engines and the other cannot fly a 737-800 on one engine…and when you hear that one asian Airline is ran with 34% of their domestic pilots who haven’t got the required qualifications and certifications, you may wonder…about “differences” 😢 on both planes and crews…I know one pilot instructor who ended his career in the area where he qualified a large portion of trainees as “hopeless” and always “right” when they were doing mistakes and then, are unable to progress that way…so we must be careful but globally (but not a generality across the board)..the early hours flight accidents are due to a critical technical issue and if the material holds up well during many flight hours, at landing time, the accidents have often human errors as one if not the major root cause. Some health issues (and errors) specially on older pilots can also be generated by the much higher stress as landing approaches…that’s why single pilots commuter flights after a certain age of 50-60, should have a backup on board , you cannot rely exclusively on a automatic landing AI almost system, one single glitch not in place and the plain plane salut is gone…That is why each incident must be investigated throughly, otherwise it will always be the dead pilot fault, not to blame the airline or the manufacturer or the trafic control, forcing enormous compensations requests for the victims …","66: 어떤사람들은 이 사건이 조작된것이라고 생각한다.\n비행기 착륙과 사고장면은 그래픽이고 \n 저 콘크리트 뒷편에 불을 질렀다는 추측이다.\n사고현장의 사진은 콘크리트 앞은 깨끗하고 그 뒷편만 흔적이 있다. 여러 사진을 보면 그런 의심이 든다","67: Joining dots from 2 different pages?

DANG","72: No foreign object damage to the no.1 engine (because it wasn't spinning)...the first officer was the pilot not flying but he identified the incorrect engine to shutdown (probably due to not having had a good massage back in Bangcock, Thailand)....Pilot error IMHO","73: It was perfect. What you say the pilots did or did not do, they hit the runway. They should have run off into a field or the water, or a prepared area for runaways.  They should be the heroes now but a design flaw killed them. I know that land is expensive so it would be interesting if this Barrier was to protect  a population area. What led to the forced no choice landing is a curiosity. It will be sad to learn that there was no bird control because of the holiday and back ups at all positions including ATC. It will be 3 contributing factors that led to touch down. IMO the engine was powered but not turning, but trying. IMO The landing gear was not deployed because they knew if they did the speed would not have allowed them to stop. They were coming in hot. The last photo of the co pilot bracing on touch down indicated they were doing what they could and mostly intentional based on circumstance. If it was ICN everyone would have lived.","74: Another YouTuber mentioned this and I'm going to keep posting about it... Why didn't the pilots try to use their rudder to avoid the wall? The rudder was working for landing, but they never tried to use it on the ground. If I saw that wall getting bigger and bigger in my window, I would have stomped on the rudder to try to move the plane away from it. They didn't even try to move the rudder. Did they completely forget how airplanes work? Did they just give up?","75: 6:56 🤣","76: Question: from a pilots perspective, how do you know which engine a bird has hit? Visually? Do you turn your head and look? Or do you go by equipment?","77: They trying to hide human error most likely.","78: Kegworth uk pilot turned the wrong engine \nBlades striped off turbine\nOn running eng, the one on fire ,blades not striped off on good engine as it was not running on impact \nCasues of crash pilot error PIC had his back broken in crash\nPlane hit moterway short of runnway\nAs you see port engine not running blades intact\nStb engine blades striped off so it was burning and turning","79: The China plane crash that occurred a few years ago was revealed to be intentional by one of the pilots. It’s actually covered by a lot of western sources. You can find the coverage on YouTube as well. Let’s not act like democrazies are better at being transparent - the propaganda machine that keeps the population brainwashed, misinformed, ignorant and braindead on the activities of the alphabet organisations in the west is the most active in the world.","80: Such a strange incident which won’t come clear until the CVR and FDR are made public.  They clearly had thrust at the point they’re executed a go-around. They also had hydraulics as they retracted the flaps and gear which both require hydraulic pressure to retract.  Then something happened on the missed approach which caused an immediate return to the airfield.  Perhaps the wrong engine was shutdown. Or perhaps both engines were damaged after the bird strike with at least enough thrust to execute the go-around before losing enough thrust to stay airborne.  I’m concerned about the landing with the landing gear retracted.  The fact that the right engine thrust reversed was deployed on landing indicates they had hydraulic pressure.  In that case, why land with the gear retracted, especially considering they were obviously high and fast based on touching down halfway down the runway?   There are a lot of unanswered questions.  I’m looking forward to the flight data and audio recordings.","81: How long has it been and how much has been said, yet no one seems to have demanded public release of the personal and particularly MEDICAL records of all personnel involved in this case. There have been fatal highway, railway and marine accidents involving individuals who have a record of stroke or heart failure, or who have been subject to an uptake (i.e., injection) of substances that have been known worldwide to have led to \"sudden stress disability.\" If any of the personnel on board or on the ground have wanted to or been required to have such uptakes, now is the time to shake it all out, ask the questions and demand the full answers. Nobody wants that, though, because it would mean fixing legal responsibility. Those with vested interests here are just like the White Star Line being desperate to attribute the sinking of the \"unsinkable\" Titanic on striking an iceberg, which was supposedly an \"act of God.\" Hence the kneejerk reaction this time, rushing like crazy to blame the birds.","82: Based on photos I've seen from other plane crashes, it looks like the right engine was running and sucked in debris.  The left engine does not look like it was running.  The theory that they shut down the wrong engine seems to be supported by these photos.  I hope the cockpit voice recorder reveals why they did not continue their original landing.  It seemed they would want to get the plane on the ground as quickly as possible.","83: Flying in an airliner is always a risk that the pilots may not know what to do and panic themselves.\n\nThings can go wrong fast and suddenly and the machine may be heading for the ground...the pilots may be trying this and trying that and nothing works....but one thing is always working and it's called gravity.\n\nThen those poor people are sitting in an aluminum tube out of control.....yes you are at great risk...I don't care what they say \"oh it's safer than driving to the store in your car\".....maybe so but at least you are on the ground.\n\nPilots can't know everything...and if something suddenly goes wrong, they panic themselves.... people ask why did they rush to land?\n\nThey forgot to put down the landing gear and flaps....in a panic you forget even your name....","84: It appears that they were configured for landing and were able to land instead of go around and during that process it is possible that they raised the flaps, the landing gear and it is very likely that in that short time, they turned off or reduced power in the good engine.\nIt's hard to tell at a glance whether those motors were working or not, the rest is speculation, but in my opinion both motors were spinning; one looks like it lost a blade, but that could have been from the impact with the wall, but the rest of the blades look flattened, this is consistent with a spinning blades. The same goes for the other motor, which didn't lose any blades from a possible bird strike or collision with the wall, but all of its blades look flattened or changed angle, which is a sign that the blades were spinning at the time of impact.","85: Why did they land so late down the runway?\n\nWas there conversation between the pilots and the tower?\n\nDidn't either the pilots or the tower realize there was a cement wall at the end of the runway?\n\nPilots and the tower are usually in constant communication.\n\nFrom the view of the pilots getting ready for impact, it didn't look like there was smoke in the cockpit.","86: G'day,\n\nThe Left Engine 's # 1 Fan Array appears to have incurred \"Blunt Force Trauma\", from having been filled with Dirt, on impact - while NOT being twisted by the Shaft from the Turbines....\n\nWhereas the Right Engine, tge one which was seen to ingest Birds, and to have ejected bits of Cowling  outboard in the process..., and which was seen to have been blowing Hot Air while on Approach before touchdown, and clearly had it's Thrust-Reverse Doors deployed during the Belly-skid....; \nThat Engine's # 1 Bypass Fan looked as if it had been \nAugered into the bottom of the 45° inclined Earth Ramp, chewing the dirt away from the Vertical Pillar-Walls...\n (which were REQUIRED to have been built into the Structure, due to the Typhoon/Flood-Resistance Requirements of the South Korean Government....

The Boeing 737-800 operating the flight overran the runway at Manan while attempting a belly landing without its landing gear deployed. The accident marked the deadliest aviation disaster involving a South Korean airliner since the 1997 crash of Korean Air Flight 800 in Guam and became the deadliest aviation incident on South Korean soil, surpassing the 2000 crash of Air China Flight 129. It was also the first fatal accident in Jedu A's 19-year history. The accident stands as the deadliest aviation disaster of 2024 to date, involving a Boeing 737-800 and surpassing the 2020 crash of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 and the deadliest airliner crash of the 2020s. The Jedu A low-cost carrier with a previously unblemished safety record over its 19-year history faced its first fatal accident. The scale of the disaster also made it the deadliest mass casualty event in South Korea since the sinking of the Amisu ferry in 2014, which took 300 lives. This tragedy raised urgent questions about aviation safety, particularly for low-cost carriers operating under tight budgetary constraints and emphasized the importance of robust maintenance checks, especially for aging aircraft models like the Boeing 737-800. Emergency response teams at Muan International Airport were dispatched immediately after the crash but the severity of the explosion and resulting fire complicated rescue efforts. Firefighters and medical personnel worked tirelessly to extinguish the flames and recover survivors.","comments":["0: nice"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10331"},"video_id":"2QtJMt1iFbg","title":"Jeju Air Flight 2216: A Tragic Aviation Disaster","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QtJMt1iFbg","text":"Unfortunately, only crew members were rescued alive, both suffering severe burns and fractures. Before this tragedy, the most recent comparable accident was the 2018 crash of Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737-800 which highlighted significant safety concerns and regulatory lapses. The Jedu A flight 2,216 stands as the deadliest incident involving this model, surpassing the 2020 crash of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. The accident also eclipsed other major disasters of the 2020s, making it the deadliest airliner crash of the decade. The South Korean government declared a national day of mourning to honor the victims and pledged full cooperation with the ongoing investigation. An investigative team comprising South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Boeing representatives, and international aviation experts was formed to uncover the causes of the accident. Preliminary findings indicate that the failure of the landing gear to deploy was a key factor in the crash. Investigators are examining whether the malfunction was due to a mechanical defect, maintenance oversight, or pilot error. The cockpit voice and flight data recorders have been recovered and are being analyzed to reconstruct the sequence of events. Early indications suggest that the pilots followed established protocols for a belly landing but external conditions, including adverse weather and runway length, may have contributed to the runway overrun.","comments":["0: nice"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6786879901f5e61e50d10332"},"video_id":"-ZnAQMqGge0","title":"What Really Happened 9 Minutes Before Jeju Air Plane Crash | True crime documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnAQMqGge0","text":"The incident at Muan Airport in South Korea has sparked a complex web of debates and investigations. The primary cause remains under scrutiny, but several factors are being considered: landing gear issues with the Boeing 737800 model, bird strikes, and the presence of a concrete embankment near the runway. Foreign experts have suggested that the concrete structure contributed to passenger deaths by absorbing the impact during an emergency landing. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, but video footage from the moment of the disaster indicates that the plane attempted to avoid collision with the embankment. This suggests that the presence of the concrete structure may not have been a direct cause of the passengers' deaths, as it did not prevent the plane from colliding with the runway. In response to criticism regarding the safety of the airport infrastructure, South Korea's Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the embankment. However, some experts believe that if the concrete structure is identified as a problem, both the ministry and the Korea Airports Corporation could be held accountable due to their roles in maintaining airport facilities. The case remains under investigation, with officials providing updates on new information as it becomes available.","comments":["0: Concrete wall should not be there.

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us this morning. Investigators are now focusing on a bird strike as the likely cause of the tragedy. Help us understand what may have happened. How does a bird strike cause a crash like this? Well, everything is speculation at this moment. The authorities are going through everything step by step. Bird strikes: why they are not uncommon. This appears to be a very uncommon occurrence if it was indeed a bird strike. Historically, if you look at past incidents, a bird strike may shut down one engine in rare instances like we saw with the so-called miracle in the Hudson River with Captain Sullenberger; it shut down both engines and they were able to land. They were able to ditch in the Hudson River in New York. So, bird strikes are not uncommon. The mystery to me, and I think also for the investigators is the landing gear did not appear you know, I've watched the video many times. It didn't even look like perhaps the main gear toward the middle of the aircraft had deployed; maybe not but it certainly looked like the nose gear. It looked like it was still contained within the fuselage. So that is the real mystery: why the landing gear was not deployed, and then again you mentioned a second landing gear malfunction on this plane this morning. So that is quite the coincidence. And so we'll have to look at that but apparently, the plane was in good mechanical condition; it was a 737-8, not an Max, and that is considered sort of the work for the industry. I think there's something like three or four thousand of those types of planes in service around the world. So right now, it is a mystery: I mean, the bird strikes affecting that landing gear is something that I've actually never heard of. So, what other factors could have caused the crash? It's speculation at this point and everyone hates to speculate. It could be a number of things again, maybe it was a bird strike; maybe both engines failed in that condition. I mean, it didn't look to me like the weather was a factor. It looked like it was pretty clear skies from the videos that I've seen but when you get into these situations, the pilots are really overwhelmed. They've got alarms going off, they've got systems failing; they're trying to gain control of the airplane in situations like this. In aviation, there's an old saying: \"You aviate, you navigate, and you communicate.\" Which means that you try to gain control of the plane, you navigate so that you can get to a safe landing place, and then you worry about communicating whether it's with the Tower or whatever. So again, I mean, I hate to speculate but there were multiple system failures; we won't know anything until they get the data from the flight data recorder and then also until they analyze the voice cockpit report. How long will it take to get the data from the flight data recorder? When could we expect some answers?","comments":["0: my guess (I am not a pilot, total speculation) I think it was a bird strike and it knocked out both engines, they lose all power and they couldn't use any hydraulics. \nSo this caused them to have a gear up landing, and why didn't they go around?

Well,  many question actually.  Will leave it to the investigator to do their job.","84: The plane wasn't slowing down as if the flaps and reverse thrusters weren't engaged.  I wonder if a bird strike could have also damaged the windshield, so it blew in on the crew while they were in the process of landing.  It doesn't seem possible, but a birdstrike which resulted in a cockpit disaster would mean the reverse thrusters and flaps wouldn't be engaged because the crew had been clobbered.","85: The only scenario that makes sense to me is that the pilots shut down the wrong engine or they lost both engines then hurried to get the aircraft on the ground ASAP.","86: The pilot land the plane but no landing gear","87: Why are you guys still dwelling on about the birds. It’s even shown on this video what was the cause of the huge fatalities","88: So the media can speculate and blame it on birds.

Authorities say they suspect a combination of factors caused the crash; the cause of this accident is believed to be a bird strike, and other factors such as bad weather. The exact cause will be announced through a joint investigation with the relevant agency. Rescue workers are searching the wreckage but the fire department says the plane has been almost completely destroyed in the Blaze. Identifying the deceased is proving difficult. Jayu quickly issued an apology saying they are doing all they can to respond to the incident. I would like to bow my head and apologize to all those who cherish J Drew above all, I would like to express my deepest condolences and apologies to the passengers and their families who lost their lives in this accident. 181 passengers and crew were on board the flight from Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, including at least two Thai nationals among many dozens of South Koreans. Let's speak now to journalist Jen Moon, she's at the site of the crash in Muan. Hours after the crash, I'm here at Muan International Airport, about 288 kilometers south of the South Korean capital. I can see more vehicles lining up to take bodies away and authorities are telling me that a temporary morgue has been established at the crash site. The area smells a lot of aviation fuel; I can see many workers in protective suits and masks who are combing the area, searching through bushes for possible recovered dead bodies. 124 people have been recovered with 55 still missing. Jen Moon: What's the reaction in the country to this tragedy? So a lot of shock as the crash happened took place early Sunday morning, roughly about eight hours ago. This plane crash is one of the deadliest plane crashes in South Korean aviation history so far and couldn't come at a worst time as this nation goes through political chaos with a president impeached about a few weeks ago, followed by the impeachment of the acting president, then after Prime Minister, who was the Prime Minister, and now in power is another acting president. He has declared the zone a disaster special disaster zone. He's here to look at the site and support families.","comments":["0: Sewol tragedy all over again","1: Computer graphic","2: And they say airplaines are the \"SAFEST\" travel vehicle in the world 🤷, well, statistically yes, since Airplanes are ONLY limited, that is why the death count is almost 0 to null in a year BUT it IS still a 50-50 chane you will die in an airplane regardless on any situation, UNLIKE land vehicles, you have MANY CHANCES to survice but in an airplane? nah, you all will most likely die 100%","3: Bad weather?\nThere was no a cloud in the sky, unlimited visibility, wind calm.

It's a question of why was such a heavily fortified obstruction placed so close to the airline right-of-way.

In my opinion this extreme in a short time the stabilization of the aircraft (slat ,Flap, Speed, Air brake, Gear down, Minimum Speed) within 10 miles gives little time to the pilots to manage any serious emergencies. I believe however that in this particular case the investigations could realize that the pilots did not know how to manage the emergency in the correct way attributing the disaster also to human error. This does not take away however that I would review the rules of the approaches allowing the first flaps to be extended at 20 nautical miles this continuous desire to save fuel is becoming too dangerous.","32: Where in the news did it talk about the 2 survivors?

Nothing is impossible again; it's too early to say that, if bird strikes Birds did strike the left engine and the left engine failed, if that's the case, you can still manually extend the landing gear from the flight deck. This is a 737-800 extremely reliable airplane with a very good safety record. We're seeing multiple things here: because of the aspect of flaps but also the landing gear; I just wonder was there any other way this could have been handled? Probably, I don't know if it's my ignorance of aviation, but at which point the plane hits the runway to give enough time for a skid or touchdown and scar. What if you have no flaps? The flaps will not extend; you're going to have a very fast landing speed. You pick an airport, time permitting with a very long runway as you can see from the video.

Hi, I'm Dan Milikin. The investigation into the devastating Juu Air crash at Muan International Airport, which occurred on December 29th, 2024, has encountered a significant setback as both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) ceased recording approximately four minutes before the aircraft's impact. The incident, marking the deadliest aviation disaster on South Korean soil, saw Juu Air Flight 7C-2216, a Boeing 737-800 carrying 181 individuals, belly land without its landing gear deployed and slide until it impacted an antenna structure. The crash resulted in the deaths of all but one passenger.","comments":["0: Here's our initial report: https://youtu.be/P3U_REggAtk","1: 5:20 So if the control tower granted them permission to land on runway 19 that means the pilots must have been communicating with the tower and requested that abrupt course of action.

Why didn’t the flight deck crew just continue for landing on RKJB 01?","43: Is THAT what you’re asking? You should as WHY they are  missing.","44: Thank  you so much for this video.  I'm a lowly private pilot and found your video the most informative of many videos on this great tragedy.","45: If its a Boeing then you're dying.","46: My $500 laptop has it's own battery. Now we find out these black boxes which are made to withstand bomb blasts require an external power source?

No one has referenced that.. . Ban flights until black boxes checked.. you still should have gotten data.","50: My SPECULATION\n\nFor the power to cut to the CVR and FDR at the SAME TIME as the pilots declare mayday and initiate a go-around would indicate a bird strike to both engines and not an inadvertent shutdown of the wrong engine. The timetable is just too compressed.\n\nAlmost no pilot's immediate reaction during a go around is to shutdown an engine especially after a bird strike. Even with master caution for fire you're not going to shutdown an engine within a handfull of seconds of the problem happening. That would be almost completely unconscionable. Possible for sure, but totally ridiculous.","51: Who the hell needs the black boxes? There must be construction plans of the ingenious plane-stopping wall both in digital and printed form stored somewhere and that was the sole cause of the tragedy.","52: https://youtu.be/yki3ODerbSY?t=237 - Isn't it true that this aircraft was bought by Jeju from Ryanair in 2016, so it most likely had a battery? The question, rather, is whether this battery was properly serviced by Jeju....","53: Hit by EMP weapon?","54: Where are the black boxes? Those recording boxes are NOT black! They are orange.","55: Look, it's simple. For some unexplained reason the pilot or pilots did a GO AROUND. My understanding is that the bird strike to right engine happened AFTER.  On  go around flaps retracted, gear up. Perfect response. It's apparent that the left engine was shut off by mistake. The fan blades would have been twisted on impact. They're reasonable considering. The thrust reverser appears \"on\" when the plane is skidding. That shouldn't be like that. Means it was STILL running on impact with the runway, not shut off. No thrust, no reverser. It's right there. They shut off the wrong engine. Both engines compromised could cause circuit breakers to flip. That model doesn't run on battery back up. They had no choice but to skid stop.","56: Why are they trying to cover this up? Just confirming what we know already, and now we are certain they WOULDN'T be addressing the issues","57: I feel like Boeing is just hiding the results because it’s their fault.","58: When the left engine on that DC-10 separated, it took all the associated hydraulics with it.","59: FACTS:\n- bird strike made most systems fail\n- the pilots were FABULOUS and even so, they landed the plane and reduced the probability of dying to a minimum\n- a totally IDIOTIC placed concrete wall killed then all!!!\n\nSo, birds and boing increased a lot the likelihood of dying but pilots and their training reduced that to a minimum. The wall killed them","60: A very far fetch but what about an emp attack/accident, partially crippling the electronics.","61: It sounds strange that the pilot hadn't got landing gears ready yet at 8:59, exactly when they declared the May-day.","62: Maybe they were all hijack.","63: Let's hope they will find some helpful info on what got recorded before the last 4 minutes of the flight.","64: Tile should read: Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why","65: This has got Epstein \"suicide\" vibes.","66: Birds completely disabled the plane…birds! Engine exhaust video evidence indicates birds ingested in both engines. Unless the pilots accidentally shutdown #1 engine (instead of #2 that had partial power after compressor stalls) BOTH main generators went offline and both hydraulic pumps stopped working. Only the batteries allowed manoeuvring with the flight controls. Lack of sufficient power during the overshoot necessitated the crew to not be able to do an organized assessment of the situation and also prevented flap & gear extension. Stupid birds effectively disabled and brought down the entire plane. 🤦‍♂️","67: Need to find the QAR or quick access recorder and see if any data can be recovered","68: you think the South Koraen government would learn from the sink of MV Sewol. you can't hide!!! \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_MV_Sewol","69: Thanks Dan for the update","70: I wonder if the systems made the pilots *think* the gear was down,  It had been down before, so if some failure in the electronics retracted the gear, the pilots may have presumed it was down without rechecking.    Or in their rush to land they had retracted it for some unknown reason yet forgot to put it back down.  Or someone selected the wrong switch which retracted it when it was too late to put it back down.","71: Thanks for wise commentary/analisys!","72: No way. No way! The black box doesn't have a battery? It makes no sense to me. One of the obvious reasons for plans crashes is if all electricity and hydraulics go down - and these are usually both dependent on the engines, no? So how come the CVR/FDR were ever allowed not to be backed up by batteries? \nAlso, they are supposed to transmit a signal for a long time after a crash, so that they can be found (e.g. in the middle of the ocean) - how can they transit such signal with no battery? Or is the battery for signal transmission a different one than the one for the actual operation of the device?","73: If he declared “go around” on Short Final (the first final) he should have had the flaps extended long before short final. Even we the GA pilots never skip our Approach checklist, I don’t understand why did the do a final with a clean cruising configuration? If the flaps were extended on this first final I don’t see why they should have been retracted completely on go around - to reduce drag (since with one engine only) is a good logic but then some flaps would have as well reduced the Stall Speed, besides Drag was actually needed on the last final. They did a “circuit” of sorts, they should have had flaps extended on the “downwind” leg.","74: \"Why is the MISSING Last 4 Minutes of Jeju Black Box CRITICAL?\"\nBecause that's when the crash occurred? 🙄","75: 95% it's the fault of pilots. Unless there is black and white correspondence or voice communication between the pilots and control tower. None of this happening and pilots took the decisive decision but ended up disastrous... Already commented earlier, it's time aviation authority or airlines company to take full responsibility of the paid pilots. Going forward there must be strict protocol for pilots to adhere and take orders. It's not fair that only pilots can make decision on behalf of the passengers unless they obtained clearance from the higher officer or company high level officer in charge. Implement the rules already.","76: Truly weird occurrence.","77: I have watched many airplane crash investigations, but I haven't yet heard of this type of issue with the CVR and FDR. Would be nice if you had tried to list what could have caused this particular and quite unique situation.....","78: im still waiting for one of you sheeple to answer me this \"why did the pilot of the plane that crashed in azerbaijan turn off his transmitter before turning west and flying through an active warzone?\" not one of you sheeple can answer that nor do you wnat to tell the truth. flase flag to make russia look bad. we have been lied to. AMERICA is the EVIL EMPIRE. democrats are the new nazis.","79: Pilot Criminal act?","80: Not a concrete barrier.","81: The correct procedure is to continue toward the runway & get on the ground ASAP, NOT to go around. They probably shut down the wrong engine in a panic. It has happened before.","82: I still think that the pilots must have mishandled what should've been a fully survivable incident! I don't know why they wouldn't continue with the landing which they were already configured for!","83: The puff of smoke in the video could possibly have been halon extinguisher tanks releasing due to engine fire alarms from the bird strike, which requires all electrical power to be disengaged for use.","84: Has this ever happened before that a Boeing’s data and voice recorders stopped functioning a few minutes before a crash landing? Or at the moment of an engine failure during flight?","85: Certified in 1998 - for me not. Parts of the certification are handed along from the first 737 ever, so parts of that certification you mention may result on a certification 1968","86: No, the plane probably didn't have a \"complete electrical failure\".  It seems that both engines had suffered disturbances that resulted in their generators tripping offline, but all the critical systems and instruments would still have gotten electrical power (from the standby busses).  The FDR and CVR (and ADSB) are not considered critical systems.","87: So: you want to write down a conversation with a pensil on paper. But nobody speaks. So there are no words on paper. But you say: the pensil did not work. NO! Because there were NO words to record. Now, replace \"pensil\" by CVR or by FDR....","88: I hate mysteries","89: So we have to assume there was a dual engine failure happening at EXACTLY the same time, because if engine 1 failed before engine 2, during that time there is power being delivered to the recorders and they, AT LEAST, recorded engine 1 fail. This is HIGHLY UNLIKELY i should say. And we also have to assume there was no time to start the APU. And that they couldn’t lower the gear by gravity whatever the reason was. This may be too much to accept…? One can speculate if someone has interest in erasing the last 4 minutes of the recorders.","90: YIKES. Just YIKES. Even north koreans are more transparent...","91: They lost both engines. If you look in slow motion at the footage where the aircraft passed over a observer on the ground, you can see a white puffs on BOTH engines before the compressor stall on the right engine. It's not like a condensation trail but more like white puffs. I probably can't post that link here without  @TakingOff permission.","92: The aircraft Boeing 737-8AS HL8088 was purchased by Jeju in 2017 from Ryan Air. A European airline that should have followed the requirement to have battery backup on the CVR.","93: Deliberately erased by the Koreans to hide pilots incompetence","94: looks to me like the wrong engine was shut down and maybe the pilots panicked?","95: Take Note: Many aviation \"experts\" are going on about the \"Great Wall of Death\". This shtick regarding the Jeju Air Crash is misplaced, boring and unhelpful. 🤦‍ \n\nThe wall at the end of the Muan Airport runway was not the cause of the accident. Events on the plane in the minutes before were the reason for the crash. Going on about \"The Wall!\" is an exercise in distraction and deflection. With respect to the wall, Jeju Air Flight 2216 was proverbially and literally in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nMuan Airport over 17 years has hosted more than 100,000 take offs and landings with no problems at all with the wall.\n\n\rNote: The concrete retaining wall that Ayrton Senna hit at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola at 14:17 CET 1/5/1994 at a speed of 233 kmh was not the cause of his death. His loss of control of the Williams FW16 in the seconds just before the impact was the reason for the crash. It is an imperfect analogy with the Jeju Air Crash but you get the point.","96: A couple of questions I posed on Sat. 11/1 to Chris Brady 737:\r\n\r\n(1) Do you know what sort of CVR was being used on the Boeing 737-8AS registered HL8088? \r\n\r\n(2) What is the normal Chain of Custody for a CVR after a crash? \r\n\r\n(3) Do you know if Flight 2216's CVR was using/connected to a Recorder Independent Power Supply (RIPS)? \r\n\r\n(4) If a 737 loses all electrical power, will the CVR still work/record? \r\n\r\n(5) Can a pilot or co-pilot disconnect/turn off a CVR, either pre take off or in-flight?\r\n\r\nHe replied: \r\n\r\n\"I have no way of knowing what type of CVR was fitted or if it had RIPS, that will come out in the investigation. Chain of custody depends upon the country of the accident. ICAO Annex 13 has a preferred path but it isn’t always enforced. Re “all electrical power” if all electrical power is lost then all electrical items will be unpowered. You need to understand that there are different types of electrical power - 3 generators, AC & DC busses, standby busses, various batteries etc. Watch my electrical videos for more info.\"\n\nAlso, I have been told from a Boeing employee the CVR on Flight 2216 was a Honeywell HFR5-V model.\n\nCVR with data link recording (DLR) system is made for commercial air transport aircraft to accommodate mandatory cockpit voice recording. It simultaneously records four channels of audio present at its inputs. The HFR5-V CVR retains the most recent 2 hours of recorded information in solid state crash survivable memory.","97: Something so diabolical happened in that 4 mins they want to hide it despite knowing that no one would believe it.","98: APU is F.I.R.S.T.","99: Do the maintenance people check the health of backup batteries often?"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d1039c"},"video_id":"yki3ODerbSY","title":"Why is the MISSING Last 4 Minutes of Jeju Black Box CRITICAL?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yki3ODerbSY","text":"The FDR and CVR are crucial for understanding what happened during those final moments. Without them, investigators must rely on other evidence to piece together the events leading up to the crash. Witness reports have indicated that the landing gear was initially deployed during the final approach, with flaps extended, but at some point, both were retracted—a standard procedure in a go-around maneuver. The CVR would have provided insights into why the crew decided to abort their initial landing attempt and whether there was an issue with one or both engines. It could also reveal if the thrust reversers were functioning correctly. These answers are vital not only for satisfying curiosity but also for preventing future tragedies. If the crash resulted from mechanical failure, identifying the cause could save lives in the future. Conversely, if pilot error was to blame, new training procedures could be implemented. A similar situation occurred near Colorado Springs in 1991 with United Flight 585. For years, investigators couldn't determine what caused it, and suspicion fell upon the flight crew for a seemingly perfect 737 suddenly crashing into the ground. Three years later, another 737 crashed on approach to Pittsburgh under similar circumstances. Initially, people were quick to conclude that the pilots might have inadvertently or even in panic stepped on the wrong rudder pedal. However, test pilots and simulators could recover from such scenarios every single time, raising questions about why these crews couldn't. It was only after investigators recovered the Rudder Power Control Unit (RPCU) that they discovered the fluid remains very cold at altitude, and then on descent, hot hydraulic fluid in a few cases caused the unit to seize and deflect in the opposite direction commanded by the pilots. In the stop-in-reversal scenario postulated by the NTSB, the pilot makes a high-rate rudder command to the left; the primary valve extends to its travel limit and should be followed by a movement of the secondary valve. However, the secondary slide jams to the outer case, allowing the primary valve to overtravel, resulting in a misalignment of the hydraulic ports. This allows hydraulic flow in the wrong direction and causes the rudder actuator rod to retract rather than extend, moving the rudder in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots. Boeing disagreed with these findings, claiming it was still pilot error. The FAA initially agreed but then changed its position after a special task force reported in July of 2000 that it had received many potential failures of the rudder system in tests. Boeing agreed to add some redundancy to the rudder control system, and time has proven the NTSB correct as there have been no more crashes like this since the redesign. This is why we need to know what happened during the Juu Air crash. It might seem like pilot panic, but if we can ascertain the real cause, we can address that cause with solutions to prevent it from happening again.

Although I never flew any variant of the 737 (only about 5000+ hours in the jumpseat) certainly the last few seconds of data has at least some indication of engine and system parameters.","27: It's about time to sip through passenger roster to see who is/are worthy such elaborated scheme","28: This plane used to be in the Ryanair fleet.","29: I never set foot in a 737. Just a pile of crap.","30: As thirty plus year airline pilot I have to ask WHY, WHY, WHY did they do a go around for a F*CKING BIRDSTRIKE ???????? There is no salvation by going BACK into the air !!!! Especially in area that is well known for heavy bird activity. Now he risks getting an additional bird strike !  You get a bird strike you continue the approach and land the Goddamned jet !","31: I don't believe it, it's a cover up. Was this murder, who was on the passenger list?? also number two engine was still producing power on landing, so they would have had power to the boxes....what was the thinking, nothing adds up??","32: There is a major corruption issue with: the National Transportation Safety Board.","33: That is another piece of the puzzle, the fact that both plane devices and the atis quit at the same time is another piece of the puzzle, and so on and so on, be patient! This is going to take a while. The ILS installation design and approval of its installation is independent issue that can be actively investigated while the plane part of this tradegy will struggle for a long while.","34: Was there no recording or was there no electric power supply? No recording does not always mean no power!","35: South Koreans are not good handling accident consequences. Remember the MV Sewol\n2014 ferry disaster in South Korea?","36: Why cut the video?","37: Better question, why is it missing at the first place?And who are the people that need that 4 minutes to disappear? Are they from the Korean government? The Boeing company?","38: Something very fishy here.","39: For you pilots out there I am curious to what are the procedures (if any) when receiving warnings of birds being in the area of the airport?","40: If this wasn't so tragic it would be funny.","41: 737 DEI program","42: You are missing an important point. The recorders have data up to 8:59. At that point, the aircraft was just 2 miles from runway 01 at 600 feet AGL, fully configured for landing and by the looks of it, fully stabilized. Why didn’t the flight deck crew just continue for landing on RKJB 01?","43: Is THAT what you’re asking? You should as WHY they are  missing.","44: Thank  you so much for this video.  I'm a lowly private pilot and found your video the most informative of many videos on this great tragedy.","45: If its a Boeing then you're dying.","46: My $500 laptop has it's own battery. Now we find out these black boxes which are made to withstand bomb blasts require an external power source? Convenient.","47: And another very useful and objective analysis from Chris Brady of the Boeing 737 Technical Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKoCI9kVtc","48: Frustrating!","49: Check the other aircraft ? No one has referenced that.. . Ban flights until black boxes checked.. you still should have gotten data.","50: My SPECULATION\n\nFor the power to cut to the CVR and FDR at the SAME TIME as the pilots declare mayday and initiate a go-around would indicate a bird strike to both engines and not an inadvertent shutdown of the wrong engine. The timetable is just too compressed.\n\nAlmost no pilot's immediate reaction during a go around is to shutdown an engine especially after a bird strike. Even with master caution for fire you're not going to shutdown an engine within a handfull of seconds of the problem happening. That would be almost completely unconscionable. Possible for sure, but totally ridiculous.","51: Who the hell needs the black boxes? There must be construction plans of the ingenious plane-stopping wall both in digital and printed form stored somewhere and that was the sole cause of the tragedy.","52: https://youtu.be/yki3ODerbSY?t=237 - Isn't it true that this aircraft was bought by Jeju from Ryanair in 2016, so it most likely had a battery? The question, rather, is whether this battery was properly serviced by Jeju....","53: Hit by EMP weapon?","54: Where are the black boxes? Those recording boxes are NOT black! They are orange.","55: Look, it's simple. For some unexplained reason the pilot or pilots did a GO AROUND. My understanding is that the bird strike to right engine happened AFTER.  On  go around flaps retracted, gear up. Perfect response. It's apparent that the left engine was shut off by mistake. The fan blades would have been twisted on impact. They're reasonable considering. The thrust reverser appears \"on\" when the plane is skidding. That shouldn't be like that. Means it was STILL running on impact with the runway, not shut off. No thrust, no reverser. It's right there. They shut off the wrong engine. Both engines compromised could cause circuit breakers to flip. That model doesn't run on battery back up. They had no choice but to skid stop.","56: Why are they trying to cover this up? Just confirming what we know already, and now we are certain they WOULDN'T be addressing the issues","57: I feel like Boeing is just hiding the results because it’s their fault.","58: When the left engine on that DC-10 separated, it took all the associated hydraulics with it.","59: FACTS:\n- bird strike made most systems fail\n- the pilots were FABULOUS and even so, they landed the plane and reduced the probability of dying to a minimum\n- a totally IDIOTIC placed concrete wall killed then all!!!\n\nSo, birds and boing increased a lot the likelihood of dying but pilots and their training reduced that to a minimum. The wall killed them","60: A very far fetch but what about an emp attack/accident, partially crippling the electronics.","61: It sounds strange that the pilot hadn't got landing gears ready yet at 8:59, exactly when they declared the May-day.","62: Maybe they were all hijack.","63: Let's hope they will find some helpful info on what got recorded before the last 4 minutes of the flight.","64: Tile should read: Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why","65: This has got Epstein \"suicide\" vibes.","66: Birds completely disabled the plane…birds! Engine exhaust video evidence indicates birds ingested in both engines. Unless the pilots accidentally shutdown #1 engine (instead of #2 that had partial power after compressor stalls) BOTH main generators went offline and both hydraulic pumps stopped working. Only the batteries allowed manoeuvring with the flight controls. Lack of sufficient power during the overshoot necessitated the crew to not be able to do an organized assessment of the situation and also prevented flap & gear extension. Stupid birds effectively disabled and brought down the entire plane. 🤦‍♂️","67: Need to find the QAR or quick access recorder and see if any data can be recovered","68: you think the South Koraen government would learn from the sink of MV Sewol. you can't hide!!! \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_MV_Sewol","69: Thanks Dan for the update","70: I wonder if the systems made the pilots *think* the gear was down,  It had been down before, so if some failure in the electronics retracted the gear, the pilots may have presumed it was down without rechecking.    Or in their rush to land they had retracted it for some unknown reason yet forgot to put it back down.  Or someone selected the wrong switch which retracted it when it was too late to put it back down.","71: Thanks for wise commentary/analisys!","72: No way. No way! The black box doesn't have a battery? It makes no sense to me. One of the obvious reasons for plans crashes is if all electricity and hydraulics go down - and these are usually both dependent on the engines, no? So how come the CVR/FDR were ever allowed not to be backed up by batteries? \nAlso, they are supposed to transmit a signal for a long time after a crash, so that they can be found (e.g. in the middle of the ocean) - how can they transit such signal with no battery? Or is the battery for signal transmission a different one than the one for the actual operation of the device?","73: If he declared “go around” on Short Final (the first final) he should have had the flaps extended long before short final. Even we the GA pilots never skip our Approach checklist, I don’t understand why did the do a final with a clean cruising configuration? If the flaps were extended on this first final I don’t see why they should have been retracted completely on go around - to reduce drag (since with one engine only) is a good logic but then some flaps would have as well reduced the Stall Speed, besides Drag was actually needed on the last final. They did a “circuit” of sorts, they should have had flaps extended on the “downwind” leg.","74: \"Why is the MISSING Last 4 Minutes of Jeju Black Box CRITICAL?\"\nBecause that's when the crash occurred? 🙄","75: 95% it's the fault of pilots. Unless there is black and white correspondence or voice communication between the pilots and control tower. None of this happening and pilots took the decisive decision but ended up disastrous... Already commented earlier, it's time aviation authority or airlines company to take full responsibility of the paid pilots. Going forward there must be strict protocol for pilots to adhere and take orders. It's not fair that only pilots can make decision on behalf of the passengers unless they obtained clearance from the higher officer or company high level officer in charge. Implement the rules already.","76: Truly weird occurrence.","77: I have watched many airplane crash investigations, but I haven't yet heard of this type of issue with the CVR and FDR. Would be nice if you had tried to list what could have caused this particular and quite unique situation.....","78: im still waiting for one of you sheeple to answer me this \"why did the pilot of the plane that crashed in azerbaijan turn off his transmitter before turning west and flying through an active warzone?\" not one of you sheeple can answer that nor do you wnat to tell the truth. flase flag to make russia look bad. we have been lied to. AMERICA is the EVIL EMPIRE. democrats are the new nazis.","79: Pilot Criminal act?","80: Not a concrete barrier.","81: The correct procedure is to continue toward the runway & get on the ground ASAP, NOT to go around. They probably shut down the wrong engine in a panic. It has happened before.","82: I still think that the pilots must have mishandled what should've been a fully survivable incident! I don't know why they wouldn't continue with the landing which they were already configured for!","83: The puff of smoke in the video could possibly have been halon extinguisher tanks releasing due to engine fire alarms from the bird strike, which requires all electrical power to be disengaged for use.","84: Has this ever happened before that a Boeing’s data and voice recorders stopped functioning a few minutes before a crash landing? Or at the moment of an engine failure during flight?","85: Certified in 1998 - for me not. Parts of the certification are handed along from the first 737 ever, so parts of that certification you mention may result on a certification 1968","86: No, the plane probably didn't have a \"complete electrical failure\".  It seems that both engines had suffered disturbances that resulted in their generators tripping offline, but all the critical systems and instruments would still have gotten electrical power (from the standby busses).  The FDR and CVR (and ADSB) are not considered critical systems.","87: So: you want to write down a conversation with a pensil on paper. But nobody speaks. So there are no words on paper. But you say: the pensil did not work. NO! Because there were NO words to record. Now, replace \"pensil\" by CVR or by FDR....","88: I hate mysteries","89: So we have to assume there was a dual engine failure happening at EXACTLY the same time, because if engine 1 failed before engine 2, during that time there is power being delivered to the recorders and they, AT LEAST, recorded engine 1 fail. This is HIGHLY UNLIKELY i should say. And we also have to assume there was no time to start the APU. And that they couldn’t lower the gear by gravity whatever the reason was. This may be too much to accept…? One can speculate if someone has interest in erasing the last 4 minutes of the recorders.","90: YIKES. Just YIKES. Even north koreans are more transparent...","91: They lost both engines. If you look in slow motion at the footage where the aircraft passed over a observer on the ground, you can see a white puffs on BOTH engines before the compressor stall on the right engine. It's not like a condensation trail but more like white puffs. I probably can't post that link here without  @TakingOff permission.","92: The aircraft Boeing 737-8AS HL8088 was purchased by Jeju in 2017 from Ryan Air. A European airline that should have followed the requirement to have battery backup on the CVR.","93: Deliberately erased by the Koreans to hide pilots incompetence","94: looks to me like the wrong engine was shut down and maybe the pilots panicked?","95: Take Note: Many aviation \"experts\" are going on about the \"Great Wall of Death\". This shtick regarding the Jeju Air Crash is misplaced, boring and unhelpful. 🤦‍ \n\nThe wall at the end of the Muan Airport runway was not the cause of the accident. Events on the plane in the minutes before were the reason for the crash. Going on about \"The Wall!\" is an exercise in distraction and deflection. With respect to the wall, Jeju Air Flight 2216 was proverbially and literally in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nMuan Airport over 17 years has hosted more than 100,000 take offs and landings with no problems at all with the wall.\n\n\rNote: The concrete retaining wall that Ayrton Senna hit at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola at 14:17 CET 1/5/1994 at a speed of 233 kmh was not the cause of his death. His loss of control of the Williams FW16 in the seconds just before the impact was the reason for the crash. It is an imperfect analogy with the Jeju Air Crash but you get the point.","96: A couple of questions I posed on Sat. 11/1 to Chris Brady 737:\r\n\r\n(1) Do you know what sort of CVR was being used on the Boeing 737-8AS registered HL8088? \r\n\r\n(2) What is the normal Chain of Custody for a CVR after a crash? \r\n\r\n(3) Do you know if Flight 2216's CVR was using/connected to a Recorder Independent Power Supply (RIPS)? \r\n\r\n(4) If a 737 loses all electrical power, will the CVR still work/record? \r\n\r\n(5) Can a pilot or co-pilot disconnect/turn off a CVR, either pre take off or in-flight?\r\n\r\nHe replied: \r\n\r\n\"I have no way of knowing what type of CVR was fitted or if it had RIPS, that will come out in the investigation. Chain of custody depends upon the country of the accident. ICAO Annex 13 has a preferred path but it isn’t always enforced. Re “all electrical power” if all electrical power is lost then all electrical items will be unpowered. You need to understand that there are different types of electrical power - 3 generators, AC & DC busses, standby busses, various batteries etc. Watch my electrical videos for more info.\"\n\nAlso, I have been told from a Boeing employee the CVR on Flight 2216 was a Honeywell HFR5-V model.\n\nCVR with data link recording (DLR) system is made for commercial air transport aircraft to accommodate mandatory cockpit voice recording. It simultaneously records four channels of audio present at its inputs. The HFR5-V CVR retains the most recent 2 hours of recorded information in solid state crash survivable memory.","97: Something so diabolical happened in that 4 mins they want to hide it despite knowing that no one would believe it.","98: APU is F.I.R.S.T.","99: Do the maintenance people check the health of backup batteries often?"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d1039d"},"video_id":"uxMyQdVuZyo","title":"SEEKING ANSWERS TO TRAGIC PLANE CRASH","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMyQdVuZyo","text":"There is an emphasis on conducting a transparent investigation to prevent future incidents.

Eyewitnesses reported flames and sparks from the right wing, indicating engine distress possibly due to bird ingestion. Crash and Aftermath: The plane skidded down the runway on its belly, eventually colliding with a concrete structure housing the Instrument Landing System (ILS) antenna array, leading to a catastrophic explosion. Concerns Regarding Airport Infrastructure: Frangibility Standards - The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates that structures near runways, such as ILS antenna arrays, should be frangible—designed to break away upon impact—to minimize aircraft damage. In this incident, the aircraft collided with a non-frangible concrete structure, exacerbating the crash's severity. Runway Safety Area (RSA) IO Standards: Require clear runway and safety areas (RAISA) free of hazardous obstructions. The presence of a solid concrete structure within this area raises significant concerns. Potential Negligence and Criminality: \n- Negligence in Maintenance and Operations: If JUU Air failed to adhere to maintenance protocols, leading to the aircraft's mechanical issues, this could constitute negligence. Delayed emergency reporting and crew training gaps could also indicate operational shortcomings. - Negligence in Airport Infrastructure: The non-frangible structure violated ICAO safety guidelines, suggesting possible negligence by the airport authorities. Criminality: Gross negligence manslaughter could arise if JUU Air or airport authorities knowingly ignored critical safety issues. Violations of ICAO regulations or falsified safety documentation could lead to criminal charges. Critical Questions:\n- Were JUU A's maintenance schedules and safety checks up-to-date? - Did airport authorities conduct proper hazard assessments for infrastructure placement?","comments":["0: I would think every runway should have a \"skid section\" at the end or at minimum have no barriers at the end.

The wall was located 250 meters past the runway and was unmarked on airport charts, which made it difficult for the pilots to avoid. How could better marking of the runway hazards have prevented this tragedy? The plane had reportedly experienced a bird strike before the crash, which caused damage to its landing gear. The pilots struggled to control the aircraft during the approach and immediately reported issues with the landing gear. Despite their efforts, the plane failed to land safely and ultimately hit the concrete wall. The impact led to a massive explosion that caused immediate fatalities. Why was the damage from the bird strike not detected earlier by the pilots or crew? The airport's use of a rigid concrete wall to support a localizer sensor was called into question after the crash. Aviation experts have argued that the use of such a rigid structure, rather than a flexible or non-rigid barrier, increased the crash's severity. If the barrier had been more flexible, the damage could have been less catastrophic. How could flexible materials have minimized the damage caused by the crash? JU-Air, the airline involved in the crash, issued a formal apology to the families of the victims. The airline also allowed itself to cooperate fully with investigators to determine the exact cause of the crash. They promised to provide financial and emotional support to the affected families. How can airlines ensure they are better prepared to support families in such devastating situations? This incident marks South Korea's worst domestic aviation disaster in recent history. Among the victims were passengers of all ages, including a 3-year-old boy and a 78-year-old woman.","comments":[],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d103a4"},"video_id":"WOVWtPO2anY","title":"Tragic South Korean Plane Crash Claims 179 Lives #SouthKoreaPlaneCrash #JejuAir #MuanInternational","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOVWtPO2anY","text":"The crash has shocked the nation, and many families are now grieving the loss of their loved ones.

A national mourning period was declared by the South Korean government, lasting for seven days as the country paid tribute to those lost in the tragedy. Memorial altars were set up nationwide, allowing people to honor the victims and show their support to the families. How can public mourning and remembrance help the nation heal after such a tragedy? As investigations continue, authorities have vowed to review safety procedures at Muan International Airport and other airports across the country. They will also be assessing the standard for runway markings and the safety of barriers near runways. How can the government improve its oversight of airports to prevent similar tragedies in the future? JU-Air has been under intense scrutiny due to the crash, with critics questioning the airline's safety practices. The airline has promised to implement new safety protocols and review their emergency response systems. What role does the airline's internal safety culture play in preventing accidents like this? The cause of the crash is still under investigation, and it is expected that authorities will release a full report in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, South Korean officials have promised to cooperate with international aviation organizations to ensure that all factors leading to the crash are identified.

So there are numerous speculations over what contributed to the crash, but let's start with this bird strike theory. How devastating can a bird strike be? A bird strike refers to a collision between an aircraft in flight and birds. Research shows that when an aircraft flying at 370 kilometers per hour collides with a single bird weighing less than one kilogram, the resulting impact can reach approximately five tons. Such a force can easily shatter the aircraft's windshield. If a bird is ingested into an engine, it can cause engine malfunctions, potentially leading to cascading failures in electrical and hydraulic systems as well as critical issues like the inability to extend the landing gear. Bird strikes are quite common. For instance, in the United Kingdom, over 1,400 wildlife strikes were reported in 2012, with around 100 instances directly affecting aircraft. In South Korea, 650 bird strike cases were recorded across 14 airports between 2019 and August of this year. Notably, this incident is the deadliest in South Korean history. Indeed, so hundreds of bird strikes, and these bird strikes are not uncommon. Then what about the landing gear problem? What does it mean for landing gear to malfunction? This time, the landing gear consists of two main components: the nose gear and the main gear system. The main gear system facilitates braking through a wheel-braking mechanism while the nose gear provides directional control on the ground via a nose-wheel steering system. In essence, without a functioning landing gear system, pilots may not be able to land safely. Even if they manage to land, they may face significant challenges in reducing the aircraft's speed or maintaining directional control on the ground. Well, we have to talk about this concrete wall that was stalled at the end of the runway now. Some are suggesting that had the wall not been there, the plane would have instead hit a fence. Is that what your take is on this? Well, according to South Korea's Deputy Transport Minister, both ends of the runway at Muan International Airport are equipped with safety features featuring green buffer areas before reaching the outer wall. However, in this instance, the aircraft likely failed to extend its landing gear and flaps due to a possible hydraulic system failure. Usually, a no-flap landing requires a high approach speed—about 10% more. To make matters worse, the pilot landed the aircraft at the one-third mark of the runway, which is 2.8 kilometers long, already eight hundred meters shorter than those at other airports. Consequently, despite the presence of green buffer zones, they might not have been sufficient to stop the aircraft before it collided with the wall. I think investigators should consider this issue seriously. As for whether the absence of the wall could have reduced the severity of this incident, I believe it would be premature to speculate. A definitive answer will emerge after the authorities conduct a thorough investigation into this incident. Definitely, it sounds like a combination of all these variables that could have led to the crash. Now, to look into this case, two black boxes have been recovered, which will hopefully provide key clues as to what exactly happened. Now how long will it take to retrieve information from the two black boxes? The black box, also known as the flight recorder, consists of two devices in a commercial aircraft: the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). The FDR and CVR are designed to survive crises like this. International regulations mandate that they withstand impacts of up to 3,400 gravity forces and temperatures exceeding 1,100 Celsius. It has been confirmed that the flight data recorder of Jeju Air Flight 7C-2216 was retrieved, although parts of its exterior detached. If both devices are intact and undamaged, the decoding process could be completed within a week. However, if data damage is detected, the process may take at least a month or more. In cases of severe damage to the FDR, the investigation may need to be handed over to the US National Transportation Safety Board, which could extend the black box decoding process to over six months. Is that what you're saying? The black boxes need to be sent to the US for further analysis? That's right.","comments":["0: Bird strike is commonplace and NOT the issue.

The main question most have is, \"After initiating the go-around and then lining up for the runway, why wasn't the landing gears and flaps deployed?\" This would have slowed the plane considerably and provided a much shorter stopping distance. My guess is that something happened in the cockpit, e.g., smoke or possibly broken windshield that partially incapacitated the pilots and prompted them to decide an immediate landing was needed, even though the flaps and gears were up. We'll find out soon, thanks to the black boxes.","12: media ofcourse working hard to cover up the true cause of the deaths, which is the concrete wall built by corrupt government officials","13: If wall hadn't been there, would plane have ended up on highway 815?","14: Hey, media, who's interviewing the person who recorded the viral runway video?","15: Hong likely has had a dozen COVID vaccines","16: Lack of transparency and accountability which sounds typical in Korea… the airport was probably built too fast and cheaply to monetize profits over safety.

The passenger list also had issues with identifying a couple of the passengers, why is that?!?

This is more than just a story; it's a tragedy that has left a nation in mourning and raised questions the world cannot ignore. A routine flight—one of thousands that take off every single day—turned into an unimaginable disaster. Families torn apart, lives lost, and a haunting question lingers: why? How could something like this happen, and could it have been prevented? Today, we're taking you deep into the heart of the South Korea plane crash investigation. It's a story of heartbreak, accountability, and the relentless pursuit of answers. This isn't just a report; it's a journey through raw human emotions and a quest for the truth. So stay with us because this story demands to be heard. It began as an ordinary day: the skies were clear, and passengers boarded Flight 9-17 with little thought of what was to come. Families hugged goodbye, friends exchanged laughs, and some settled into their seats ready for a short, uneventful journey—but what awaited them was anything but ordinary. Midway through the flight, something went catastrophically wrong. Witnesses on the ground reported seeing flames and smoke trailing from the aircraft in a horrifying descent. The plane crashed, shattering not just the aircraft but the lives of over 100 passengers and their families. Emergency responders raced to the scene, their faces etched with determination and grief. They did all they could, but for most, it was already too late. In the days following, the airline's CEO, Kim eBay, addressed the nation. His face showed a mix of sorrow and resolve. He stated that no safety issues were flagged during pre-flight checks. These words were meant to reassure the public but only fueled skepticism: How could a flight so routine, so well prepared, end in such a devastating crash? If no issues had been detected, how could trust be restored? To address concerns, the airline announced plans to reduce its winter traffic by 10 to 15%. This move was emphasized as not an admission of overextension but sparked debate: Was it a genuine attempt to prioritize safety or a desperate effort to deflect blame? The questions began to pile up, each one more haunting than the last.","comments":["0: ❤","1: Nice information"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d103af"},"video_id":"ochZMQhHu2M","title":"SOUTH KOREA PLANE CRASH: The Tragedy That Shook a Nation | Full Investigation","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ochZMQhHu2M","text":"Was it human error?

Every passenger had a name, a face, a story, and every family left behind carries an unrelenting grief along with a single demand: answers. Investigators are under immense pressure. Every piece of wreckage is being analyzed, every black box recording scrutinized. Initial findings suggest potential issues with the plane's hydraulic system, but no definitive conclusions have been reached. Experts in aviation safety have raised alarms, questioning whether the pre-flight inspections were thorough enough. Could something critical have been missed? This tragedy has also brought the airline's history into focus: In 2019, the company was fined for delaying necessary safety upgrades on its fleet. Was this another instance of cutting corners to save costs, or was this truly an unforeseeable disaster, as the airline suggests? The world is watching, and the pressure to uncover the truth grows by the day. Accountability—it's the word on everyone's lips: families, experts, and even global aviation organizations are demanding transparency. The airline has promised full cooperation, but trust is a fragile thing, and for many, it's already broken. This incident serves as a wakeup call—a grim reminder of the delicate balance between safety and efficiency in the aviation industry. How do we ensure that financial pressures never take precedence over human lives? What changes must be made to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again? These are the questions we must confront, not just in South Korea but globally. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: The lives lost in this tragedy must not be forgotten. Their stories demand to be told—not just as statistics but as narratives of human experience and loss. This isn't just a story; it's a call for change—a reminder that safety should always be at the forefront of our skies.

While the crew managed to control the descent, the aircraft collided with a solid concrete wall at the end of the runway—a wall that experts argue should have been frangible to disintegrate upon impact. Runway safety areas must be designed to handle overruns. This tragedy raises questions about airport infrastructure compliance with international standards. The crash claimed 179 lives, with only two survivors—a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of seemingly small oversights in airport design. Investigations are underway to ensure such a disaster is never repeated. Families and survivors now face a long journey of healing while the aviation industry learns hard lessons from this heartbreaking event. Air Canada Express flight 2259, Halifax, Canada: An Air Canada Express flight narrowly avoided disaster when it suffered a landing gear failure. Flight 2259 was on its final approach to Halifax Stanfield International Airport when the issue arose. The crew executed an emergency landing and the aircraft skidded down the runway as one of its wings caught fire. Despite the intensity of the situation, no major injuries or fatalities were reported among the 73 passengers and crew. Emergency responders swiftly extinguished the fire and evacuated the passengers. The airport was temporarily closed, causing delays and diversions. A mechanic said in an interview that landing gear issues are rare but can have severe consequences.

However, the aircraft skidded off the runway into a grassy area. Despite the rough landing, all 182 passengers and crew walked away unscathed. The airport remained closed for several hours while investigators assessed the situation. The crew's training and the aircraft's design redundancies ensured this emergency ended without loss of life. Still, hydraulic failures are a concern that must be continuously addressed. This incident underscores the importance of maintaining and upgrading critical systems in aging aircraft fleets.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-323, operating the flight, slid off the runway during landing at Cebu after a hydraulic system failure. The involved aircraft was a 24-year-old Airbus A330-323 with the registration number HL753TO. Despite significant damage to the aircraft, all passengers and crew members managed to evacuate safely without any injuries. Chronology of the accident:  \nThe flight departed from Seoul at 19:20 and was scheduled to land in Cebu at 22:00 PHT. At 22:12 PDT, the aircraft was on its final approach to Runway 22 at Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCE). It executed a go-around for another landing attempt. The second landing attempt at 20 to 26 feet above ground level was unsuccessful, and the aircraft circled northeast of Cebu before making a third approach. On the third attempt, the aircraft successfully landed at 23:08 but couldn't stop on the runway. Weather reports indicated strong winds and adverse conditions at the time of the accident. Due to the incident, flights to MCE were either diverted back to their departure airports or rerouted to alternative airports; more than 100 flights were canceled. Korean Air promptly issued an apology and committed to conducting a thorough investigation in collaboration with local aviation authorities and Korean authorities to determine the cause of the incident. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) conducted the investigation, with assistance from the Korean Civil Aviation Office (KCAA). The initial report released on October 24th, 2022, concluded that hydraulic damage led to the aircraft's brake failure. On October 25, 2022, the captain testified that they experienced a hard landing on the second approach due to wind shear, forcing them down during the subsequent go-around. Brake warning lights illuminated, leading the crew to declare an emergency on the third landing attempt. Brake pressure warning lights activated, and the pilot couldn't slow down the aircraft.","comments":["0: I am the first, also Very cool video"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d103b6"},"video_id":"ZQAQVO_lswQ","title":"How Boeing Landed Itself in a Big Mess? #boeing #boeing737 #aviation #boeingcrash #koreanaircrash","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQAQVO_lswQ","text":"A KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 73 fiery plane crashed in South Korea killing 179 people leaving just two survivors. The final days of 2024 were undeniably tough for Boeing. On December 28, a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines KL1-1204 experienced a hydraulic system failure shortly after takeoff. The next day, Juu Airlight 7C-2216 departing from Juan International Airport in South Korea suffered a bird strike that led to landing gear failure and tragically crashed killing 179 people. Just one day later, another Juju Air Boeing 737-800 encountered landing gear issues within three days. Boeing faced one fatal crash and two major aviation safety incidents all involving the 737-800 model once again. The American aerospace giant found itself in the crosshairs of public scrutiny. But Boeing's safety issues extend far beyond this recent string of accidents. Since 2008, the 737 Max series has been plagued by multiple fatal crashes including Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 in 2019 which together claimed 346 lives. These disasters led to a global grounding of the 737 Max. Since 2021, Boeing planes have experienced a series of frequent incidents including emergency exit doors falling off, rudder pedals getting stuck, detached exterior panels, engine fires, abrupt midair descents, tires falling off or exploding and even planes getting off runways. Meanwhile, two whistleblowers who exposed Boeing's safety flaws died tragically: one by suicide, the other from illness. To make matters worse, all three major credit rating agencies downgraded Boeing's credit score consecutively and its stock price plunged from a 2019 high of $440 to just $170 today. The once proud crown jewel of American manufacturing appears to be spiraling downward. So how did Boeing, once the undisputed king of aviation, fall into such a mess? Boeing was once America's pride and joy. From the 707 in the 1950s to the 727 in the 1960s and the workhorse 737, Boeing built a legacy of quality and safety that was etched into the hearts of Americans. In the late 1960s, Boeing took a massive gamble by developing the 747 jumbo jet with room for 490 passengers and engines twice as powerful as anything else at the time. The 747 revolutionized air travel making international flights affordable for the first time. Before the A380's debut, the 747 held the title of the world's largest passenger aircraft for 37 years and boasted one of the best safety records in aviation history. In 1997, Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas. In its desperation to outpace Airbus, Boeing spent over $40 billion on stock buybacks. Critics argue that this capital could have been better spent on research and development to counter Airbus's A320 Neo. In reality, Boeing's research and development budget as a percentage of revenue actually declined between 2011 and 2015. As former CEO Harry Stonecipher once said, \"Boeing was a great engineering company but investors demanded a company that could make money.\" The over-financialization of American industry has stifled innovation—a lesson painfully clear in Boeing's story. Short-term shareholder returns at the expense of long-term investment ultimately lead to losses on both fronts.","comments":["0: Not the video being 7:47","1: Sensationalist journalism at it's finest.

To those who don’t think and analyses, that should be a bird strike. \n\nThe turbo fan is located about 20% from intake nose. For bird strike, the puff of smoke should either show up by 20% point or behind the exhaust and see by the tail fins and not exit the side at 50% point. \n\nNormally the main engine inlet is masked behind the turbo fan hub, hence protected by it.

Whip a u-turn instead of a go-around due to lack of thrust.  Keep flaps and gear up to maximize glide.  In the panic, way over estimate the distance to the runway.  Blow your one and only chance by coming in way too fast.","21: Helmet looks stupid","22: You state a no gear landing would take over 9000 feet or the whole length of the runway.   But add no flaps  and faster landing speed then this plane may need over 14000 feet.   Thus there was no safe landing space especially when the missed the first 5000 feet.  Maybe a water landing should have been done.","23: I think they lost both engines, so they rushed to land and the gears and flaps","24: This was your best YT video to date. This is right up there with the best of Blancolirio and Mentour, Well done.","25: would love to see a sim video where one engine is out and the approach continues - is it possible to do a normal landing ?","26: The mystery around this landing is so profound.  I’ve watched so many videos, and a belly landing seems so out of ordinary in these circumstances.","27: REASONS for AIRCRAFT CRASHES\r\r\n\r\n(1) Weather. e.g. Heavy cloud or fog > Low visibility.

This means that the flaps were extended (1 video also shows this). \r\nWe do not know whether the landing gear was already extended - but at the time of the bird strike video the landing gear was retracted. Then there was a bird strike; first on engine 2 (right). The aircraft was within the glide path (position A).\r\n\r\nAnd now allow me to speculate - i'm with you.... When the flaps have been retracted (and they have to be), the 737 is in the aerodynamically best glide, but no longer in the prescribed glide path (too high). This is because the glide path was intended for a flap position of approximately 30°.\r\nIn order to land at 01 again, the 737 would have had to fly a 360°, set flaps and landing gear again and make the second approach.\r\nMaybe the crew had this in mind - we don't know - what I can only say as a pilot: If you have hit a flock of birds, never fly a 360°! The approach on 19 was right decision.\r\nWhy? Because you may be flying through the same flock of birds; most birds climb in the flock in the thermal.\r\nBut if at that exact moment engine 1 (left) is in trouble (because we know that engine 1 was not running when we landed), then the 737 is in the configuration of the best glide and now at position B (wherever this is - but not in axis to 01 and not in the glide path, that's for sure).\r\n\r\nWe don't know why engine 1 wasn't running; the crew may have switched off the wrong engine or there may have been a second bird strike - that's speculation. But then the 737 is too high for the 01. Ok, then the 19 is the right decision.\r\n\r\nBut then the cross - approach to 19 must be longer so that you can see the position to the tochdown point of Rundway 19.\r\nOnly if you can see this point can you lengthen (you are too high) or shorten (you are too low) the cross - approach.\r\nIn the final - when the glide path becomes visually predictable for the crew - the landing gear is dropped (only gravitiation required, takes about 7-10 seconds the gear ist set & locked in B 737). In addition, you must choose the touchdown point BEFORE the runway because the ground effect takes effect in the flair - every pilot knows this. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that it was no longer possible to extend the flaps (engine 2 in stress, engine 1 shutdown). But it was possible to set the landing gear. The landing gear also destroys a lot of the ground effect. As pilots, we can see - also visually - that we are going too fast. We also know that at over 170 kts no touchdown is possible. So - forgive me for this comment - but that's exactly why we all learn to trim the way for the final approach over the ground... With slight S-curves.\r\nThis allows us to fly additional distance and destroy altitude (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). We practice this very often in the simulator!\r\nThe 737 without flaps ...again: We pilots know that! - the 737 only touches down when it is much, much slower. Yes, it is very critical to land 35-40 tons without flaps. But it is a plane.\r\n\r\nWhatever - we are in our chair an have no stress... It's easy for us to talk. but, even if we have a COMPLETE engine failure in a stable glide path, there is no reason for all these maneuvers. We are all (really ALL pilots) learning: You can't stretch the glide path of an airplane - there's a limit here, but you can ALWAYS degrade the glide path. Be it by slipping, be it by changing the course over ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh damn, this is all so tragic. The lost souls, the poor sisters, brothers and parents... They have lost so much. The best that can be made of this tragedy: Learn from it, make things happen, make flying even safer, make training even better.... And make aerodormes safer (berms ... )\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to adapt the approach procedure for all aircraft. The approach must ALWAYS be high enough to ensure that the runway remains accessible in the event of a complete engine failure, the runway remains accessible. There is also the question of the APU. Shouldn't the APU ALWAYS be started by a bird-strike in the future as a sunful procedure -  or even if there is an engine problem on approach? The APU needs 120 seconds to supply the electrical energy for the flaps - too late in an emergency procedure such as this flight after the bird strike.","29: The 737 with no landing gear sits naturally on its engine pods and its belly on a nose up pitch. They would have to use the elevators to lift the tail and bring the nose down. If they had dual engine failure while going around they would have been probably stuck with nose up trim and without hydraulics in a 737 it's very hard and slow to change the trim. You have to crank the trim wheels by hand and they are very hard. It's possible they just couldn't lower the nose.","30: Even if there were crew errors, it’s tragic to think that it might have been survivable without that concrete. It’s really weird to watch the end, realising that one moment they were all completely well, and then they were no longer conscious humans, except for two. Absolutely awful.\n\nI’m tempted to get a VR headset!","31: \"Had a little bit of an issue\". Gobsmacking understatement.","32: The left wing was definitely producing lift. You can see daylight under the #1 engine nacelle as the plane skids by.","33: You certainly have an original approach to this channel, Stan. Who the hell puts a berm at the end of a runway overrun? Dumb AF.","34: Thanks for information.","35: \"Wings were producing lift on the runway.\" Waaaaaaaaahhhhh. Fail, fail, fail on the part of the pilot.","36: When you want to look like an idiot put a VR head set on.","37: Nicely explained, but the VR headset reminds me of the Light Sabre kid. Cheers from Canberra. 🇦🇺","38: Thanks for the great video. Question, couldn't the rudder have been used, with or without hydraulics to veer off the runway to avoid the berm?","39: Great and informative video. Thanks for the lecture. 👍","40: Great explanation. Thanks","41: Great info and insight, thank you","42: The landing speed is suggesting the flaps would’ve been up and not 15°\n\nIt looks a lot like they had a complete electrical failure. \n\nNone of the exterior lights can be seen from the landing footage… not even the beacon light!","43: Weird that they appeared to be set up for landing but panicked with the bird strike & did a go around… had they continued initial approach with gear down & flaps set, aircraft would most likely had a safe landing. My guess is incompetency & panic in the cockpit….","44: South Korea is not going to release the data or recordings. That is not how they do things. It will all be covered up. It is fairly obvious that they declared a mayday and did a go-around when they probably should have landed. And then they got half configured for a one engine landing and decided to crash land the aircraft.  It is almost comical to hear non aviation people talk about this accident.","45: Thanks","46: you look beyond ridiculous.","47: It's now looking to be more than 90% likely that they switched off the wrong engine by accident after the bird strike, not knowing which was worse. \nWith only one damaged engine in operation, this would explain a scenario where they only had enough hydraulics available to operate ailerons, rudder and elevators but not enough anymore to operate the gear and the flaps. \n\nIt also explains the decision not to go to a holding pattern.\n\nAlso, the only available thrust reverser could have been close to useless in this scenario, which explains the lack of deceleration capability.","48: The more I see of this crash landing it really points to the wrong engine being shut down, even in this video theres confusion between the no1 and no2 engine. In the panic to land no gear or flaps were deployed","49: You know your stuff, but you talk way too fast and misspeak from time to time.\n\nWhy did they \"Go Around\"?  They were set to land on Runway 01.\n\nDid you say or imply that switching a squawk to 7700 would stop the transmission of ADS-B data?  That doesn't make any sense without some electrical failure.  Flights change squawks from time to time during flights regardless without, I believe, stopping ADS-B data.\n\nYou're not a good narrator.","50: My hypothesis: the plane hits the birds with both engines, the compressor stall caused energy fluctuations to pump through the electricical system which in turn caused the software to malfunction.\nWhen pilots saw that the instruments were malfunctioning they decided to land immediately.\nThey lifted flaps manually so all they were able to do about 15 degrees.\nThe plane was coming in hot  because one of the engines was pushing, while the other engine released the spoiler, that's also why it took so long to hit the ground.\nFAA can release the CVR but they won't because Boeing is more than too big to fail, Boeing's demise is a National Security Risk. So they will clean the Data as much as possible to save the company.\nAs for me, I'll listen to the Boeing Whistleblowers. They warned us about bad engines, wiring, landing gear, software and so on and so forth.\nI'm a just a frequent flyer, not an expert but as a customer I know that I can avoid airlines with a high percentage of Boeing Aircraft.","51: Is there any way i could contact you? 737 captain in training here. From Brazil.","52: How long does it take to lower the gear manually, from putting the gear lever in the correct position, to opening the panel door, to all three showing green? Is this value known to the nearest second based on sim training analysis?","53: ** Hopefully all of these questions will be answered when they release the voice recordings from the cockpit.  When do you anticipate these recordings will be released?","54: @2:48 you talk about a compressor stall being seen out of engine #1 while showing a video clip of the plane passing directly overhead... but that's engine #2 that actually had the burst of fire in it's exhaust trail, isn't it? Engine #1 is under the left wing, engine #2 is under the right wing.... right? Engine #1 was clearly not running upon touchdown, it had no vapor trail or heat signature by that time... Engine #2 however was still running though not in good health. Good informative video though! As a Computer Scientist with experience developing GUI interfaces I do not like some of the layout of that dash panel on the plane though... controls AND their dials should be grouped together and not separated from each other for example (ie. flap levers and the flap dials... why do they have so much separation between them?).","55: What value does it add to look at you in a VR headset occupying half the screen?","56: SK was providing updates on the CVR work through Sat or Sun, at which time they reported they were almost done transcribing the data and expected to be done in a day. \n\nIt's been radio silence for 4-5 days. It makes me think they have evidence that the pilot(s) were at fault. Otherwise, they'd already be pushing the narrative that the pilots did a great job.","57: Landed “belly up”?!?

Wish to shake your hand someday.","1: I'm rather surprised such a large transport aircraft isn't always required to have a standby backup power source for the recorders that can take over at a minimum when there is no weight on wheels. I would have expected the recorders to be prioritised to the same degree as the primary flight instruments for getting power, as in my view at least, losing the recorder data could cause an indirect risk of loss of life due to subsequent accidents. But i guess with the way the 73 was upgraded in such a piecemeal fashion, it would have been difficult to integrate cleanly and consistently across the fleets, but then again I get the idea that some AD will get sent around after this accident requiring RIPS and similar installations to be added to whatever aircraft don't already have them.","2: Nicely done Chris!  I do agree Boeing's philosophy on maintaining electrical power to systems essential for flight control and that the black boxes aren't critical for getting the aircraft on the ground.  That said if we don't understand the human factors and what failures they are dealing with in an emergency then there will always be the possibility of it being repeated.  \n\nP. S. I believe in the Alaska Air plug blow out incident the crew forgot to pull the breakers and the CVR data was lost.","3: Good presentation. \nCVR starts recording as soon AC power is available for aircrafts without switch .this will record the preflight ,  briefing...","4: Speculatively, number 2 engine is damaged, the engine speed is low enough that the generator drops offline but continues to windmill sufficiently for the EDP to supply a small amount of hydraulic pressure, the crew elect to go around to go through checklists, they clean up the aircraft and retract the gear and flaps, the crew then shut down the left engine, all main AC power is lost, including power to the recorders, the crew elect to land immediately but land very long without gear, flaps or spoilers, there is sufficient hydraulic pressure to deploy the right thrust reverser during landing. \nRIP to the passengers and crew. 🙏🏻","5: As a technical guy this was the best explanation on the internet of how these systems work !  got a new sub.  Great work !","6: You are an infinite well of knowledge for the 737 💜 thank you so much!","7: Excellent video, thx","8: 15:05 I have a question. If FDR doesn’t have any standby power. Why there is a DC(BAT) breaker in the FDR field on 737 classic’s circuit breaker panel? Doesn’t it mean FDR has battery? Or it’s only for 737 classic? If so, is there a photo of a 737-800 made at 2009?","9: Simply put, if there were no independent standby battery packs, then when no electrical power was produced for whatever reason, the recorders would definitely have stopped recording immediately. From what you said, this could be determined. However, we cannot determine if that plane has or not had independent standby battery packs installed.","10: Great video Chris, as always!  I must admit, I only became aware of the concept of the CVR/FDR requiring both engines to be running (or the APU) after reading the Air Transat A330 report a few years ago, and being astonished.  If anything is likely to lead to an accident in a twin-engined aircraft - it's not have both engines running!  So, it would be pretty useful to be able to analyse the final stages of the flight, for what must be a minimal electrical power consumption.  Hopefully RIPS will become mandatory soon, although in the Air Transat incident 10 minutes would not have been sufficient for the whole descent.","11: So, the #2 Gen is possibly damaged  by the bird strike and then the crew inadvertently shuts down #1.  On battery power now but no recorders.  Correct?","12: Is the FDR connected to Hot Battery Bus in case of AC power failures?","13: I maintain 737s for a large operator in the USA and am very surprised to learn that RIPS isn't a requirement on all NGs. Our fleet has had them for years. Truly shocking this isn't actually required equipment.","14: Great video! Minor correction, for RIPS battery life, it’s not “at least” 10 minutes, it’s EXACTLY 10 minutes. The regulations require RIPS to provide power for 10 minutes to the recorder with plus or minus 1 minute margin. The battery can definitely provide power for longer but it is designed to cut off after 10 minutes due to concerns of powering it on for too long will overwrite previous data.","15: Shutting down the incorrect (undamaged) engine would also be a possible cause no?","16: So in theory, if the plane was dispatched with APU under MEL and it did lose both engines, that would be enough to explain the loss of flight data and voice recorders ?","17: Could they have dispatched with a failed generator and not had the APU running as a way a single failure could take down both transfer busses ?","18: Thanks Chris, good analysis. As you sort of covered, a schematic isn’t the same as a wiring diagram so ‘Loss of AC ’ at the FDR and VCR can actually be caused my damaged wiring.  Seeing where the wiring to the two recorders is diverse and where it isn’t would be interesting.","19: If fire is occurred in gas turbine engine and can not be cleared by lowered the throttle, pilot can use fire extinguisher.\nSince the fire extinguisher is only one time use, if the  connection in user panel is wrongly connected, the good engine may be cut off by fire extinguisher.\nThe connection can not be tested on ordinary checking.","20: i work at wendys bro tell me what happened, the south koreans edited the at the last 4 minutes to cover up the accident and save face huh","21: The CVR should be operating under all scenarios. A battery dedicated to power the cvr should have been realized, like a backup power source in many consumer electronics. Design flaw by Boeing and overseen by the FDA, imho.","22: I do not see the logic in saying the recorders do not need a battery backup because they are not needed to get the plane down to the ground. That logic implies that the recorders are never needed in any emergency situation, so then why have them on the plane in the first place?","23: Thank you very much for the essential explanation of CVR, FDR power. Great!","24: Chris, I would be interested to learn about the sensors and indicators presented to a pilot allowing determination of a failed engine. I understand that fire detection is indicated. Modern jet engines are full of sensors, given capability of condition monitoring systems is there a warning of severe shock/vibration resulting from bird strike?","25: メーデーと共にブレーカー落とした説","26: So just wondering what the power source is for the CVR when it continues recording for 5 minutes after last engine shutdown (not RIPS). This would mean no AC power on the aircraft, or is it powered by ground power or APU. Great informative video as always and bang on 100% accurate information. Thank you!","27: If the landing gear was lowered in the Jeju incident, would the brakes have been operable?","28: I think they should stream the black box data in real time to a computer on the ground.","29: There is a lot of focus on the recorders stopping to record data, or audio, respectively, and usually stopping to work is taken to be synonymous with electrical power being cut. But isn't there a second factor? For data to be recorded, the recorders must obviously work, but additionally some external system(s) must supply the data to be recorded. With the recorders located in the back of the aircraft, both audio and most, if not all, of the data must be transmitted from far away, e.g., cockpit audio comes from the very front of the aircraft. How redundant are these connections? How plausible is it that the flow of data was cut? Notably, the transmission of location data to the ground stopped seemingly at the same time. Is there a single point of failure that could interrupt the transmission of all the sensor data?","30: 15:30 ... That doesn't look like an ID collar on the Voice RCDR circuit breaker. It looks like a lockout collar. Note how high the CB looks.","31: Has it been confirmed at ADSB and recorder data stopped at the same time? We’ve all read that claim, and it seems logical, but at this point do we know for sure?\n\nIf not, we’re presuming… and we know what that means.","32: Great Job. Thank you from Seoul ❤","33: But engine #2 was still running, which we know from the plume of hot air, the open TR doors, and the damage to the fan blades. And if engine #2 is still running, there should have been power on AC Bus 2. Very mysterious.\n\nDo you know the sample rate of the FDR? Is there a chance that we can get at least some of the engine data before it stopped?","34: I think they shut down the wrong engine, and as the right engine was damaged (but still running) it might have not been performing over the 50% threshold, and the FDR/CVR would not get power.","35: Ok now I know where to send all the conspiracy theorists. Great explanation!  So... what would happen if the phase and frequency of #2 generator went out of alignment and instantly zapped gen #1... theoretically speaking.","36: Insurance companies should refuse to pay out on any policies where the recorders failed because the aircraft design permitted the recorders to fail.  In this case it appears the pilots shut off both engines and also failed to turn on the  APU.  That should be prohibited by the aircraft design.  So if Boeing designed this so that it could fail, then the FAA SHOULD GROUND all applicable 737s until Boeing fixes this design flaw.  Boeing has been literally getting away with MURDER.","37: Thanks for your commitment, time and effort that goes into providing accurate and factual information rather than just assumptions or guesswork. People like you deserve a medal for contributing this stuff for free.","38: Chris, great info in this video.  In trying to get some data to help explain what happened, do you know if the engine FADECs retain operating parameters that can be downloaded assuming the FADECs survived the crash?","39: A designer and manufacturer of complex equipment should not require a government mandate to apply sound engineering principles and design.  Simply amazing. This ranks right up there with having only one sensor input to a system like MCAS.  Did all of the real engineers at Boeing retire or resign 20 years ago?","40: As a retired electrical and systems engineer, I am astonished that Boeing doesn’t power the CVR and FDR from a battery powered emergency bus.  Boeing continues to impress me with their lack of sound engineering.","41: Wouldn't the RIPS stop working 10 minutes after the battery bus drops below 20v, rather than 10 minutes after loss of AC power? \n\nIf that were the case, then you would get the 20-30 minutes of battery power, then the 10 minutes of RIPS power, right?","42: Next chapter should be autoflight pls captain","43: Hang on, did you mention an electrical relay is needed to manually lower the landing gear?","44: Nice video and explanation. Accident report will be an interesting read to say the least.","45: Thank you from Korea. This video really helped me to understand How FDR and CVR are working.","46: Rigid!!!!! Thank you, Chris!!!!","47: The engine was still windmilling. The complete cut-off of electrical source from both engine generators is inconceivable.. there is also standby battery system to rely on.","48: Vampires at work!!!  Why several systems stopped working at the critical moment.... The Korean people should demand to know the truth. The embankment at far end of runway is a red herring.","49: You say that RIPS keeps the CVR running for 10 minutes after every flight. Doesn't this mean that the battery gets discharged once per flight? Lithium ion batteries can usually only handle about 10,000 full cycles. Does this mean that the RIPS battery needs to be replaced every few thousand cycles?","50: Excellent video! When you said that the OFF light on the FDR illuminates when power is LOST - what is the power source to illuminate that light without external power?","51: Thank you Chris. One hypothetical question.  If the only working engine was shut down,  would the FDR record that action, just before losing power and stopping?","52: Another Boeing screw up","53: Thanks for the info concerning FDR and CVR plus RIPS, which would not help anyway. TR power is derived from 115VAC generator bus and if you loose this bus than TR is \npretty much useless. As electrical engineer I find RIPS design strange and useless, standby DC power would be much better alternative power source. At the same time \nwhen FDR and CVR stopped recording data, plane transponder quit working. Where is that unit powered from?","54: Could a right engine overspeed cause an over voltage/higher frequency from the generator and damage the AC bus that way?","55: Is it possible that they pulled the fire suppression systems on the engines before they started the APU?","56: Thanks Chris!  There is some speculation that they may have accidentally cutoff the wrong engine following the bird strike. So if the strike only affected one engine, and they turned off the wrong engine, without starting the APU, would that result in the recorders stopping if the plane does not have RIPS? Not to say that they did that, but just from a technical perspective?","57: Unfortunately a lot of us are on the speculation team, and a few on the sensationalism team for this incident.","58: Does the NG (and Max) have a RAT in the event of total generator failure?\nI presume it would only again be DC for essential flight functions, but not hear anyone mention a deployment in this incident.","59: Wouldn’t they have at least called out shutting down an engine, even if it was the wrong one? The only way it could be without any voice communication recorded about the incident is if the bird strike shut down both engines at the same time?","60: Mishandled Abnormal?\n\nWhat if an ENG Fire Handle was pulled (& turned?)?\n\nIt’s a non-recoverable action.","61: Thanks Chris. I note that you didn't mention the loss of ADSR data 7 mins before the crash and also that you thought it extremely unlikely that the crew (or one of them) would have pulled the circuit breakers.  I still can't get my head around Juan's assessment where the crew did a 180 degree turn that put them on the trajectory to the berm especially with no gear/flaps/spoilers and a high energy approach. As awful as that may be, I assume that someone will be considering whether this was a deliberate crew action.😥","62: Thanks Chris ! Always enjoying your tutorials, cheers !","63: Brilliant Chris, I took a look through your material and Boeing FCOMs with no luck. This is great, thankyou","64: 3:05 If engine 1 fails, does the tie bus automatically close, or does the pilot need to do so manually?","65: Not mentioned, and hopefully NOT a contributing factor, but pulling fire handles trips the generators off. Just a thought that has crossed my mind in the course of this mystery.","66: What about the lack of ADSB data.  Is it accurate that ADSB the data stopped about the same time as the CVR/FDRs","67: I believe birds hit Jeju aircraft some 9 kilometers off the runway treshold/crash location, at altitude of about 1300 feet, one minute (or more) before ADS-B stopped transmitting and FDR/CVR stopped recording.","68: What is the source of CVR power for the five minutes after engine shut down?","69: I have 10k hours on the 73, and I always learn something new from your videos. Thanks!!🎉","70: Where are the circuit breakers in the cockpit?","71: So if the bird strike killed the one engine generator, and the APU could not have been started in time, and they shut down the wrong engine, that would kill the CVR and FDR?","72: I remember this channel from the Alaska door reports !","73: Your conclusion is correct,  recorders are not essential for flight so would represent an unnecessary electrical load on the standby buses. Additionally with AC power off few of the systems parameters recorded would be available.","74: Thanks for sharing your knowledge","75: Chris, your comment about circuit breaker collars is mystifying- the collars are meant to ensure that the breakers stay pulled, as shown in the picture. They are NOT meant to make them easier to pull by the flight crew.","76: My question is. Then why is there a CB called DFDR DC (BAT) ?! Hmmmmm??? What does it do?!","77: Thanks Juan for giving us the link to this channel ❤","78: Also, the ADSB data was lost at the same time, which led me to believe that they were flying on standby electrical power and using the number 2 transponder. The number 1 transponder would have worked on standby electrical power. Given the number 2 transponder was selected on was likely because it was the First Officers leg. This will be confirmed with CVR data. The number 2 transponder gives altitude  data directly from the First Officers altimeter. The other scenario would have been transponder antenna damage by the birds.","79: Very good explanation of a ridiculous situation highlighted by your somewhat surprised manner regarding why a free option might not be taken and why it was an option in the first place. Thank you","80: Two things - apparently the FDR CVR are AC powered. So, like you said it isn't on the standby bus and if it was it would require an inverter to power it. Not sure anyone would want an inverter on a battery powered bus. \n\nSeems like powering these via DC would make them more flexible and easily powered by a battery bus.","81: Can I throw a theory at you ? This aircraft came out of maintenance, the APU was told to the pilots to be inop, the tie bus switches for some reason were turned off, but not turned back on, they had a double engine failure, what would happen, not a pilot but ATA engineer. Remember, we also lost the transponder at the same time as the CVR and FDR","82: I don't see how damage could have been a factor in the recorders fail due to there not being any obvious way a bird could do that!","83: Blancolirio sent me here:  I thought batteries even out or smooth out the generators producing power so that loads get a steady, even power supply.  I'm surprised everything isn't getting power from a battery (being charged) to smooth out power fluctuations.","84: @14:55 Thank you Cris. A question though about the Circuit Breakers (at 14:55). On the photo, there is a C/B called DC (BAT) for the DFDR.\nBut at the begining, you say that the DFDR is only supplied by the AC bus. Or did I misunderstand something ?","85: All you can depend on it seems is the positions of certain important switches/breakers in the cockpit if in fact the panels survived in good enough condition to determine what was going on.","86: Exactly the video we need, when some others are pushing clickbait or conspiracy theories.  Should be compulsory viewing for all.","87: Thanks Chris as usual a great informative video. Regards from a senior 737 skipper. I like that you don’t come with your own personal views or suggestions of what might have happened. Leave that to the investigators. I’m sure(myself included) we have our own theories, but we are professionals and we keep them to ourselves. Future video suggestion could be what it would take technically to install over the air ACARS like FDRs onboard. QAR is already available at least in my company within 5 min after landing. 2 years ago a story>By the time we arrived to the gate one time, the Operations guy already got a message from our technics that we have had a hard landing…. If I agreed or not to it being a hard landing is not relevant here, but I think it’s about time we can send these data streams in the air while flying. (Like engine data on wide bodies) they could be overwritten every 2 hours or so like the real FDR. CVR we don’t need to send OTA in my opinion. All the best and waiting more great videos from you","88: Thanks for the video! Why isn't it battery powered if lost both engines (which really could be happening, due to bird strike, severe weather or fuel loss). Is it also what I have heard that some of the instruments and such blackouts until you get an engine or APU started? If so, that's also a real stress factor that may impacted. Also the APU need some time to turn on, they did not have much time to land the plane. Newer Airbus has Ram turbine that pops out incase of an power failure which also could prevent this.","89: Different Aircraft (A320) , but USAir 1549 into the Hudson lost thrust on both engines. Capt Sully quickly toggled APU. Did Airbus get this right? APU takes time and I don't recall a loss of CVR, FDR in that aircraft, even after engines went and before APU. Airbus different and had standby? Or were circumstances different? Was the engine still providing some power on the busses?","90: the jeju  737 was ex ryanair .  just wondering  was there an under lying  problem with this  plane seen ryanair got rid of it","91: Quality info is clearly your strength. Thumbs up for presenting the facts and staying away from speculation, it's a recipe you do well. Thanks for the info.","92: I was just waiting for you to publish this video! Many thanks.","93: If we factor in the loss of ADS-B data does that narrow things down to just loss of AC power?","94: This is EXACTLY what I've been waiting for🙏 By FAR the best, most informative resource around as always. Thanks Chris!","95: Thanks Chris! This was the critical info I was desperately searching for. Jb.","96: Pourquoi les boîtes noires ont continué de fonctionner dans l’avion de Sully alors qu’il n’y avait plus d’alimentation électrique non plus. Le système de protections des données des boîtes noires est-il meilleur dans les Airbus ?","97: If During 2 engine fail , how long use vhf radio communiction between plan-controltower?\n\nThx captain","98: Excellent video as always!

At 8:57 a.m., a warning about bird activity in the area was issued. At 8:59 a.m., the pilot declared \"mayday, mayday, mayday\" and reported a \"bird strike; go around.\" The pilot then aborted the initial landing and requested permission to land from the opposite direction at 9:01 a.m. Air Traffic Control authorized the alternative landing at 9:02 a.m. The plane landed abnormally; it made contact with the runway two-thirds of the way down, and the wheels and landing gear were also absent. Investigations are still underway, but experts say there are a few possible causes that led to the deadly crash. Number one: Bird strike. Early evidence suggests that a collision with a flock of birds could have caused the engine to malfunction, but some experts disagree that the bird strike was the main cause as they are actually common events and modern planes are designed to support the aircraft when a bird is ingested into its engine. More than 13,000 bird strikes are reported to the ICAO each year. Number two: Electrical failure. The absence of landing gear is also unusual and has led to speculation that the plane was experiencing a catastrophic electrical malfunction. According to experts, a bird strike alone should not have been enough to cause a failure, and the plane should still be able to make an emergency landing. The presence of a wall at the end of the runway is also in question, but South Korean authorities have said that the structure, which houses a localizer antenna to help pilots maintain the correct approach path, had been built according to regulations. It could take months for more details to emerge. Meanwhile, authorities have launched an urgent comprehensive inspection of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the country.","comments":["0: Back seats are high chances to survive.","1: Pls change the narrator..mayday mayday","2: The ATC should be fired for the alternate landing(opposite direction) knowing the concrete structure was in the way. The pilot should have not aborted the initial landing attempt because the plane would have landed in the correct direction without the concrete structure so the plane could have skid off the runway into the grass area.","3: Sorry for the lives lost but its all about American quality.

You have to put it down as fast as possible because you fly a glider but you have also to consider the speed, the gliding distance, the runway length, the stopping distance, the ground effect distance until touch down, and how to slow down the plane. It's really a worst case scenario, and nobody considered there would be a fu#@ing wall at the end of the runway. I think even with wheels down they had not enough runway to slow down before the wall. The touch down is way down the runway. If they knew about the wall and the landing speed then a sea landing would have been a better option.","6: I cant understand why they landed going so fast, they could of slowed that plane down much more than what they did, no plane lands going that damn fast, plus they waisted nearly half that runway ,,,,why is that  may i ask ?","7: I dont believe they had a bird strike , they just thought it was, i think the engine blew the compressor by its self , bird do not fly that high , unless it was a lone eagle up there but they hardly ever go up that high either , not at that altitude,  i think they had a bigger problem going on, something much worse,,,,,","8: Captain/trainer: with hindsight do you think they should have just landed on the first approach on runway 1, and forget the fly around and clean up?","9: What does the impossible turn even mean???","10: Just sharing these awesomeness.\n1) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJijA0OoxI\n2) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-0EgD7urF9Q#","11: 2:09 The ceiling-fan on top of you head looks funny ;)\n\nIs anything known about the emergency that the plane is said to have had a few days before?","12: great video. don't use music mate, it's distracting","13: Probably, military surveillance equipment at Muan got information about engines emission during tear drop maneuver.","14: My question is if the main pilot was flying the entire plane manually, who's job would it be to do all the manual stuff?

Given all the speed 2216 had at that point the situation was hopeless. Is there anything about your scenario that would indicate that the pilots couldn't have executed a longer teardrop to use up more speed and land instead near the beginning of runway 19?

Your theory seems to be that they had no engines when they did the belly landing.  However, on other videos I have seen the right engine appears to be at least partially operating and you can hear the engine as the plane goes by on the runway.  Hopefully the full investigation will uncover exactly what happened and provide valuable information to improve flight safety and pilot training.","30: The TOWER CONTROL should have assisted, giving instruction , monitor constantly the Pilot action and advising correctly","31: The 2216 Jeju flight was piloted by a \"wrong-way Corrigan\" it seems; wrong runway, wrong direction which ended up a fireball on impact with a concrete structure!","32: “EXPERTS” suddenly sprout","33: If you look at the light/shadow dynamic on the plane at 5:39 showing the bird strike/compressor stall, you can see there was no image mirroring of the video.  The plane was approaching from the south in the morning.  The sun would have been to the left-back of this image (to the right and somewhat behind the aircraft), thus creating this exact light/shadow dynamic.\n\nI haven't seen definitive proof of this, but from what I've seen, it appeared the pilots flew runway heading for the missed approach and turned toward the holding pattern (northwest of runway heading), possibly in an attempt to diagnose the situation.  It then appears something happened, and they immediately turned back to land on Runway 19.  Can you confirm this?","34: Until there's more data, this video appeared to be just guessing works.","35: an opinion :   It's a 737.   ..they crash alot.  .....a mosquito \ncould hit the plane and 50 parts fall off and it crashes.  ...only crazy people  would get on one of those ancient planes designed  on a napkin  with wax crayons.","36: It could've been 50 birds for all we know","37: A passenger texted a friend and said there was birds jammed in the wing  .....possible reason the plane veered left offline on final.  ..mabie  the bird jam cleared away and control returned allowing a right turn back to land","38: Firstly there are 3 hydraulic systems, 1 on each engine and the APU, not one pilot mentioned the APU, which is the engine in the rear, this can supply all the power needed, but this engine takes 3-5 minutes to actually turn on. From mayday to hitting the wall is 3 minutes, I measured the time from one landing light to the next, which is 3 second, I can also see the landing touch down zone marks on the runway, with this data, the aircraft was 170-180 knots, about 7000 feet down runway 19, too much speed to rushed landing and floating, if that mound didn't stop it, the aircraft was leaving the boundaries of the airport and hitting cars, landing lights etc, and the end result would still be the same.","39: I believe the \"look-up\" video showing the right engine issue is NOT MIRRORED.  I also believe that video was shot from about 1000m away from the runway 01 threshold. The fact the engine is having issues + looks quite high (for being 1000m from its intended landing) and has no gear down suggests this is after the bird strike and after the decision to go around - and that if the gear had been down, it is now back up again as they begin to head north ready to make their final turn southwards onto runway 19. The new image from MBC suggests that at some point the gear was down, probably before the strike happened.  If shot from the island of GARAN-RI? or the area of BONGNYONG-RI the plane was still 8-12km from the threshold of rwy 01.","40: It just seems odd that someone randomly captures the bird strike on engine 2..... I'm thinking there was also a birdstrike on engine 1 before that, which made a \"boom\" and disabled engine 1, which caught the attention of the person, who then started recording and then caught the strike on engine 2","41: 737 models have manual operation to release landing gears! This the crew did not do. This is a mystery","42: Has anybody thought that the plane might havebeen hijacked?","43: Why did the captain fail to know that the landing gear was not working before landing? If I am not mistaken, there must be an indicator and checkpoint before proceeding with landing.","44: My take on what happened:\nPlane went through 2 birdstrikes..... 2nd one was filmed from hotel which is by the way only 1,1 kilometer away from 01 runway threshold. 1st one happened about 15 seconds before that.... I think that Flightradar captures first moments AFTER plane was struck with first birdstrike, because plane increased the speed and gained altitude at the very final moments, so they probably already cancelled approach at that time and decided to go-around.... Because the hotel (from which video was filmed) is so close to runway and birdstrike happened almost directly above the hotel  it is NOT incident which caused the emergency. Incident which was announced as birdstrike happened before incident caught on camera. \n\nOn filmed birdstrike event we can see that plane has landing gear up - and its not matter of 2 seconds..... so lets say birdstrike happens, about 1 second reaction time for pilots, announcing the mayday plus trying to climb and gaining some speed plus solving the problem with (at least one damaged) engine +  gear up sometime in process.....  I think birdstrike which caused emergency happened at minimum 15 seconds prior filmed event. It means that first birdstrike event happened at LATEST somewhere here, maybe even further to south: 34.9553128N, 126.3819350E. Then few seconds later - 2nd birdstrike even almost right above hotel.... Question is progression of damage from first birdstrike..... and then from second birdstrike - but it seems that both motors could have been seriously damaged by those events and after 1st one, they went on go around and planned landing from other side...... but then 2nd birdstrike event caused further damage which ruined their plans for standard emergency procedure and they expected to have far more time - but after 2nd birdstrike....","45: Did they release the fuel before landing? If yes why still such a big explosion?😅","46: so sad for the families of the passengers & crews... but I am more bother in the structure of the Airport itself...

Isn’t it deployed when the aircraft shifts to DC backup power?","51: I still cannot understand why they did not come in on their (first) original approach in full landing configuration. When they called out Birdstrike, they would normally have the plane in this config.","52: Left engine could had already been down before that video-taking","53: Whoever built that concrete wall at the end of the runway is partly responsible for the death of the passengers and crew!  All may have survived the crash landing!  That should be part of the investigation and be held liable!!!","54: Q2) The Plane on 2nd Approach landed \"safely\" and would the plane be intact and peoples did not die in explosion fire,  if it did not hit the earth/concrete wall?","55: Q1) Why 1st Approach without Bird Strike did not Land? This shows the Plane has some problems.","56: That landing was bordering on criminality. Why wasn't the pilot arrested?","57: He had thrust on the Number two engine. You can see the exhaust heat just as they flared. So they had hydraulics. They had about 2 minutes to do the engine loss/ landing checklist checklist, if they did it at all.  The teardrop turn was rushed. I think they shut down the wrong engine, in a panic, had partial thrust on the bird damaged engine, and either forgot to deploy flaps and gear, or thought the drag resistance from the gear and flaps would put them short of the runway, and decided to do the belly landing. There are a series of errors here.","58: what if it not a bird strike  but engine/system malfunction go boom? Just after a day jeju got another plane with problem (Flight 7C 101) also a 737-800.","59: You can see exhaust out of the right engine right before it hit the runway if you look at the front video.Looks like the right engine was working more than the left engine.","60: make sense","61: If both engines were shutdown, then the T/R operation will not be effective and therefore is irrelevant.","62: If both engines were shutdown, then the T/R operation will not be effective and therefore is irrelevant.","63: The FIRST AND MOST IMP CAUSE IS AIRPORT DESIGN. Pilot error if any comes later.\nHow can u have an airport with bird nesting areas around it as well as concrete embankments on either end of the runaway.\nThis is like INVITING A DISASTER TO HAPPEN.\nTHIS AIRPORT MUST BE SHUT DOWN AND MOVED TO A SAFER PLACE.\nMUAN CAN DO WITHOUT AN AIRPORT.","64: Above all this all about human factors, human are fragile to do error especially in such a limited time pressure, task saturation, autonomic responses  , under high pressure , low altitude, less experiences lack of training, this could create a panic reaction and cognitive overload , the only barrier is good training and CRM .","65: Based on the case where both engines fail, why doesn’t the APU automatically start on all approaches as a standard feature. Just adds another level of safety","66: Wow. The ADS-B going out really points to loss of both engines (either by error or another bird strike).","67: I am Korean and News tv shows say  it is highly likely that both engines were damaged, showing a video in which you can see smoke coming out of both engines (one more obvious than the other)","68: What is the source of the original crash video? Why is there a person standing on the roof of a dingy roadside restaurant with a professional camera setup panning the accident scene calmly?","69: If one engine had been running, then the plane would not have glided perfectly aligned with the runway, but would have skidded to one side. I'm sure neither engine was working.","70: Sir i think it is due to panic in the cabin. they failed to adop right emergency procedure","71: I’m getting very tired of watching analysis of everything except what caused the explosion and hence the deaths. It’s a four letter word to the media.Especially Korean media. W A L L","72: For me the most important piece of irrefutable evidence is the fact that the plane had sufficient power during all phases of flight. How do you manage a go-around if you don't have engines - are we saying he got a second bird strike on the other engine later on ? The \"impossible turn\" would be impossible without at least one engine running.  If you have engine power you have basically everything you need. Gear, flaps, spoilers. But none of these were used.","73: misleading, looks like there are 2 part 2. So, where is part 1?  It is due to a series of errors that made a big disaster.","74: They talk about how safe these planes are. Also how we learned from the past, and fixed the problem. How is there no safety check or a stop on the switch to shut down the only full powered engine? You shouldn't be able to shut down an engine, below 1000 to 2000 feet. If it stalls below that, it is too late to attempt to restart. Boeing is out of touch with modern tech. Everything they touch, turns to crap! I don't think Airbus is using tech from the 50's! I quit flying for work, and drive now. I can't always count on avoiding a Boeing. A 4 day ride may not be fast, but you can sure see a bunch you don't see from 36,000 feet. Plus, Boeing doesn't build anything that travels on the ground.  My heart and prayers go out to those families.","75: Innocent people died,  all but two , this is a outage, this airline should be sued huge by the families.   What a terrible way to die","76: no legal requirement for the apu to be functioning on takeoff, but they still should have had 30min of battery power for flaps. if this was caused by panic, from toga to teardrop happened so fast they never ran any checklists. hard to believe they were fighting or that frozen in fear to do the job properly. they also wouldnt have flown into that airport for the first time and known about the conrete wall. doesnt make sense.","77: I miss the music! 🎵 But I'm in the minority. Happy 2025 from Canberra. 🇦🇺","78: Great analysis 😊I’m trying to think right about what exactly happened 😢 so sad","79: Impossible turn but the plane literally pulled off the turn?","80: ThNk you for the great analysis whixh does seem to tie the current evidence together. There does seem to be some clues that the right hand engine was still operative as the plane came into land so jow would that change things?","81: Thank you so much! Very informative!!! Thanks in particular for mention of ADS-B system and discussion regarding its downtiming. I came here from Denys the Pilot videos","82: Great video! But your positioning under the ceiling fan has me chuckling!\nIt’s really hard to concentrate when it looks like you’re wearing a motorized beanie-cap!😂","83: That was a new airplane only a few months old","84: If I  saw a plane landing without gear done I would record it. Also I've twice seen a good around and recorded their safe landings","85: A GREAT review of systems and events, most detailed I've seen so far. Some are quick to blame the pilots without considering the possibility of a second bird strike and dual engine out scenario, which would perfectly explain the observed sequence of events AND vindicate the pilot's actions (if true).","86: I think I saw like droping of fuel before the bird hit the motor on the first  video","87: Can someone tell me why 'Runway one nine' is pronounced as 'Runway one niner'? Why the -er suffix?","88: I don't believe that bird strike video is mirrored either because the right side of the plane is brightly illuminated as it would be if flying towards north in the morning when the sun would be in the east.","89: Two Engine Failure Should Be Out Of The Possibilities !!!!!  No Thrust + No Lift = Step Decent Without Flight Controls Then Makes This U-Turn Maneuver With A Smooth Wings Level Landing, Impossible For Humans.....*****?????

Nothing else.","91: I think it’s worth remembering that the pilots successfully belly landed and that fewer, if any, people would have died if the wall hadn’t been there.","92: my opinion is, Pilot get panic after bird strike only one pilot was operational other was some were else. psychological way pilot believed he already deployed landing gear protocol and in panic and rushing he forgot to reconfirm.and performed landing . once he realized  his mistake hydraulics failure occurred. as we can see stability and alignment with runway smooth landing, and the landing angle of the plane while it was landing was perfect if pilot imagine he deployed landing protocols. i feel this is another question on pilots mental condition as you know 13 flights in 48hours.179 loose there lives because of industry want more profit especially in new year time ( its peek load of passengers in aviation)","93: There’s small smoke coming out of engine number 1 as well before the bird strike btw.

We bring you news today that the last four minutes of the digital flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder of the Jayu Airlines Boeing 737 that crashed on December 29 are missing. Let's get down to details: The authorities in South Korea have revealed that the last four minutes of the two black boxes are missing, which begs the question: did this aircraft suffer a catastrophic electrical failure? The reason I raised this question is because just after the bird strike—which we know happened and where at least one engine was damaged from Vision—we have seen the aircraft stop transmitting it from its transponder. The ADS-B data that goes to air traffic control, which is the data that tells air traffic control the height, speed, heading, all the relevant information required to track the aircraft, ceased at about 900 ft immediately after the bird strike. Immediately after the pilots called \"mayday, mayday\" and requested a go-around for another landing from the other end at that airport. This combined with the fact that the digital flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder ceased recording at about the same time leads to the possibility that they—the pilot—suffered some sort of catastrophic electrical failure, which seems incredible because the 737 has got two electrical systems based on the two engines and it has two battery backups, which would last each one would last at least 30 minutes. So there seems to have been some extraordinary series of events, some extraordinary failures that caused this aircraft to end up crashing on the runway at the end of the runway and killing 179 of the 181 aboard. Now because these two recording devices have failed in the last four minutes, what is going to become critical now is the evidence from the two flight attendants who did survive. The first question that's going to be asked—or should have been asked—is: Did all the lights go out on the aircraft after the bird strike? Now if all the lights went out, this would be a very telltale sign that there was some sort of catastrophic electrical failure. Absent of this cockpit voice recording and the digital flight data recording, the painstaking effort that's going to be required to find the cause of this crash could go on for years.","comments":["0: I am wondering if a high bypass engine has at least 2 disadvantages regarding bird strikes. Firstly, their larger intake would logically make them more prone to these incidents. Second, the reversers work by changing the flow of the cold gasses while the exhaust still provides thrust. So, a damaged fan could provide less reverse thrust than the exhaust, making the aircraft increase speed.","1: At 48 to 49 seconds, it looks like something came out of the left engine similar to what came out of the right.","2: I wouldn't call it a \"catastrophic electrical failure\".  The far more likely possibility is that both engines were disrupted (by the birdstrikes) resulting in their generators tripping offline.  Any upset to the rotational speed of the generators will cause them to immediately trip off (to protect themselves and other electrical components).\n\nWith both generators offline, electrical power continues to be supplied by the battery (or batteries, if the particular 737 had the second battery installed), but only to those instruments and systems that are deemed critical (e.g. captain's flight instruments).  The FDR, CVR and ADSB are not considered to be critical systems.\n\nFrom the visible damage to the engine fans, it appears the #1 engine had been shutdown (due the bird strike).  That could have been the first event in the sequence.  Soon after, the #2 engine also suffered a birdstrike (as was captured on video).  The disruption to the #2 engine may have caused its generator to trip offline - resulting in the non-critical electrical items ceasing to function.","3: Another MAS 370 episode, no one knows what happened. Highly improbable or impossible to happen.","4: I find it impossible to believe that the fight data recorders run exclusively on engine thrust. When there's 2 battery systems right there. If this is true then I will rescind everything I thought I knew about aircraft engineering and I'll never fly in a Boeing again. These data recorders were in the back and in good shape.","5: Extraordinary cover up more like it!","6: I do not currently see anything nefarious for JeJu, just a sad accident.  Loss of ADSB implied loss of both engines,  and based on my focus on MH370, I anticipated engine power may be needed for the black boxes.   Its a complex point, because the wiring diagrams  often show a battery connection to black boxes, but the purpose of that is apparently not to keep them working when main power is down.    Apparently some newer  aircraft have included 10-min CVR battery, but this aircraft was pre-2010.  The only thing I was wondering, if the pilot accidently turned off good engine, would DFDR pick up that data prior to outage.   For MH370, which is probably a different scenario, I suspect deliberate cutting engine power to certain circuits could have been done to cut off one or both black boxes.","7: It’s obvious that South Korea isn’t interested in truth.","8: A catastrophic electrical failure that allowed them to retract the gear and flaps and continue with the go-around? That doesn't make sense.","9: It's my understanding that normally each engine separately powers the two main electrical buses on a 737. If one engine was hit by birds and failed that would take down one of the electrical busses.  If, as speculated, the pilots they tragically shut down the wrong engine by mistake the second electrical bus would go down. \n\nNow either of these busses can be powered by the APU but it would take time to get it up and running. Being at a low altitude with both engines out the pilots priority would be getting the plane down on the runway.\n\nThis scenario could explain why both black boxes stopped among other things.","10: Emp from drone","11: Mysterious and sad.","12: Ask the Americans how they intercepted the data!!!!","13: They had the flaps down and the landing gear was also down during the moment of the bird strike. They should've just landed at that point","14: That’s very interesting news, going to be difficult to find out what happened","15: someone (not only one account) and AI says black boxes in 737NG don't have backup battery or can use standby power. is that true?"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d103be"},"video_id":"59_KN9BOlx4","title":"Plane Crash Mystery Uncovering the Truth  #jejuairlines","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59_KN9BOlx4","text":"So there seems to have been some extraordinary series of events, some extraordinary failures that have caused this aircraft to end up crashing on the runway at the end of the runway and killing 179 of the 181 aboard.

These were sent to the US National Transportation Safety Board for analysis. The data would have provided key evidence from the crash last month as to what happened during the last few minutes after the pilot declared a Mayday while he was attempting to land the plane. Aviation experts say that this may be due to a shutdown after both engines stopped following a bird strike; an aircraft's black box could stop recording if power isn't supplied, and in this case, it has been reported that there were no emergency batteries to provide this. The investigation board added that though the exact cause of why the recording stopped is unclear, it is pledged to further scrutinize why the data wasn't saved.","comments":["0: Cover up ffs","1: The United States government has good reason to delete the data because it would reveal a deadly malfunction that would destroy the company and Boeing is vital to the US government and therefore too big to fail.\nThe Korean government was stupid to trust the United States.","2: So the people in the tail survived, but the data, located in the tail, doesn't?

Not surprisingly, it has been all-time #1 in deficits. Plus, the airport is located in an area densely surrounded by migratory bird habitats, which has made it particularly vulnerable to bird strikes, ranking #1 in such incidents nationwide. Despite its significant deficits and safety concerns, the airport was constructed to appeal to local voters. This might be an important background for this plane crash, as its condition and preparation are quite different from the major airports like Incheon and Kimpo. Extremely sad news.","56: The jet was on final to land, when it suddenly declared a “May Day” and tried to do a go-round. After starting a mis-approach, the jet never gained enough altitude to re-enter the landing pattern. Unexpectedly, instead of doing a mis-approach and trying to land with the wind on the active runway, the jet did a 180° turn and landed wheels up without flaps, slats and with a tail wind.","57: MANO, mas uma parede?

You're watching Sky News. Let's return to our top story now: that plane crash in South Korea which has left 179 people of the 181 on board dead. The GUU Airflight arriving in Jeju in southern Korea from Bangkok skidded down the runway after making a second attempted landing; its landing gear failed to open, leaving it skidding off the end of the runway and into a wall. It exploded and killed 179 people on board. Well, to try and explain all of this now, I'm joined by the aviation expert David Lunt. David, we are grateful for you to come into the studio, especially on a Sunday afternoon, and talk to us about this—many many uncertainties as you can imagine—are still surrounding what is sadly the deadliest aircraft crash in South Korea. I know you've been studying the footage for us, having a look at it all day. What are your assessment at this hour? Well, I'm pretty shocked actually because whatever happened to the airplane which meant that the pilot couldn't get the flaps and gear down for the landing was not actually what caused the death of the passengers. The passengers were killed by hitting a solid structure just over the end of the runway where a solid structure should not be. The country's transport minister has said there is no evidence to suggest any technical fault with the aircraft itself, but that an investigation will look at all aspects of the crash including pilot error and weather conditions. As I said, if you put aerials in there for the instrument landing system, the aerials are collapsible so that if you do get an overrun, you go straight through the aerials without causing damage to the airplane. So why was there a solid obstruction there which... If you watch the footage again, you'll see not only at the time of impact did the aircraft completely crumple but also where the wreckage ends up—it had been brought to a complete halt from about 70 mph in just a few meters. And then there's never enough time is there?","comments":["Comments disabled"],"related":"Related"},{"_id":{"$oid":"678691c501f5e61e50d103c4"},"video_id":"sh25z7FpJAA","title":"Aviation expert &#39;shocked&#39; by South Korea plane crash","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh25z7FpJAA","text":"I'm sure so. So what happens now then, David? A civil investigation is launched. Tell us what will be in play right now? Well, if everything that I've just said was completely right, they're going to be asking: What on Earth was an obstruction like that doing literally within less than 200 meters of the end of the runway? I mean, that is a place where you shouldn't have obstructions. And even as I said, if you put aerials in there for the instrument landing system, the aerials are collapsible so that if you do get an overrun, you go straight through the aerials without causing damage to the airplane. So why was there a solid obstruction there which...

Every passenger was killed. Investigators are now trying to work out why the landing gear seemed to fail but the flight recorder is damaged; it'll take time to decipher the data, so today the attention has turned to what happened on the runway when the plane made its emergency landing. It was still intact but because it couldn't stop, it then overshot the runway here and we now know that it hit this concrete and orange structure that has been raised up on this grassy mound. This is a guidance system that is supposed to help planes land but this is the point at which the plane exploded into this fireball and fractured into many pieces. Aviation experts are now questioning why this was positioned in this way, so raised up and so close to the end of the runway. The acting president has ordered an investigation of the country's entire aviation industry. Without answers, the families don't know who to blame for now; the only place they can direct their anger is at the forensic teams who are still searching yet to complete their grueling unenviable task.

Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.\r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them.

Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\r\n\r\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\r\n\r\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’ ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’ ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.’” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\r\n\r\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Matthew 24: 4) –\r\n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold.

Everyone wouldve likely survived yet korean government scared to talk about that wall:","38: Its chinese drone attack","39: All airports runway should have a Runaway lane help prevent  accidents  when landing gears fail. Simi-trucks have that on freeway to stop the truck when break fail.\r\nMy condolence to the families who have been affected !","40: I know it may sound crazy but maybe that wall actually made the crash worse?","41: boeing defective part anyone?","42: Landing gear and flaps were not down. Bird strikes don't cause belly landings.Pilots may have been flying long shifts given the plane's schedule the previous day. Wall at the end of the runway....it will take a while for things to get sorted !","43: This may end up being pilot error on not deploying landing gear. Loss of one engine will not result in loss on hydraulic power. There is also an APU that will provide hydraulic and generator power in ghe event of total engine loss. Indicator lights would tell pilots that the landing gear is not deployed..","44: Second airplane crash were people in tail section survived","45: There wasn't a wall on on the runway ...it skidded OFF THE RUNWAY.

He is an opposition to Trump's America-first policy. Those who support him have similar tendencies.","47: Flying may be statistically safer but not based on survival rates per accident. On average, there are 3,287 car deaths per day internationally. More than 94% of all vehicle accident deaths are caused by user error. Road traffic crashes remain the leading killer of children and youth aged 5–29 years. One person is killed every 26 seconds on average due to road traffic injuries. Would you rather drive or fly?","48: I see the local authorities are avoiding referring to the reinforced concrete wall at the end of the runway, it was the collision that destroyed the aircraft and caused the explosion. I see mainstream media are no longer reporting on this also. What is that all about?","49: I can not believe that in the verge of 2025 a bird in a turbine will bring a whole plane down. I cannot believe that there aren't any good methods to save the lives of passengers and crew members! There have been multiple solutions proposed and nobody is taking them seriously!!","50: I would understand if it's a flock of birds.. That the plane can't almost be seen, or move. But in thr videos, there is just one 😢.. So don't blame everything to the bird. Their must be an engine error, the wall, the pilot error (sorry to mention may his soul rest in peace).

Because of the birds?.....","64: It’s a number of things, not just one. You first see an error as they slowly started to descend. There was a stall in the left engine (seen on camera) by possible bird. That has nothing to do with the hydraulic landing gear though. Instead of the pilots staying in air to assess the situation, they decided to just bypass it and land. The localizer antenna placement is a major no no in the states for that reason that took place in the crash. When you fly in different countries, that’s the risk you take. There are less regulations than in the states","65: Boeing again😢","66: No one asking...\nHow's the wall wellbeing anyway... 😅","67: I think the pilot or pilots panic after the bird strike. The landing gear should have no problem being released. It is also quite difficult to imagine the bird strike could affect the hydraulic systems controlling all the navigation systems which raised a lot of questions on the approaching speed, the landing distance, and the decision to land despite the barrier at the end of the runway.","68: never, have so many people, knowing so little, had so much to say, as found in YouTube commentary. content free speech.","69: Perhaps Boeing is not telling the truth of the many faulty issues with their planes. Since this is not the first incident","70: 6:22 She was asking how rare it is to have surviving crew perspective.

Here's what we know: The passenger jet, operated by Jeju Air—the country's largest low-cost airline—was seen in flames after skidding off a runway and crashing into a concrete wall. Look at that smoke; it's just so tragic. Nearly everyone on board lost their lives. There are many questions this morning: Why did the plane land on its belly? And why wasn't it slowing down? Transportation officials say that the pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the crash. Now, we've got to warn you here—some of the video you're about to watch is very difficult to see. Overnight, there was a terrifying passenger plane crash killing nearly 200 people in South Korea, one of the nation's worst air disasters. The Jeju Air Boeing 737, carrying 181 passengers and crew, exploded into flames when it slammed into a wall after something went terribly wrong while landing at Muan International Airport. Smoke billowed into the air as cameras captured these images near the crash site. At least 177 people were killed in the disaster, and that number is expected to rise with officials saying nearly everyone on board is presumed dead. The families of the passengers on board are gathering in an airport lounge, distraught as fire officials read the names of the victims. Jeju Air's CEO expressed his deepest apology and accepted responsibility for the crash as the company's top executive. In the video you can see that the 15-year-old jet landed without its landing gear. The plane landed on its belly at a very high speed, then veered off the runway before slamming head-on into that concrete wall. The plane then burst into flames with thick black smoke billowing into the air; debris scattered all over the ground. In the wreckage, only the plane's tail is still recognizable. Local transportation officials said that before landing, the control tower issued a warning of a bird strike and the pilot sent a distress signal immediately afterward. Just a minute later, they say the pilot issued a Mayday and tried landing the plane. Emergency crews rescued two crew members. In a statement, Boeing said: \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.\" There is still a lot that we don't know here, but we did learn that this particular plane had diverted to Seoul yesterday while on its way to Beijing. It's unclear why it diverted. We also know that Jeju Air has a very strong safety record as a South Korean low-cost carrier. There was just one other incident almost two decades ago when a plane overshot a runway, and only six people had minor injuries. Joining us now is ABC News contributor and aviation analyst John Nance. John, thank you so much for being here this morning for this very disturbing story.","comments":["0: Boeing at it again","1: My heartfelt condolences 🙏🙏🙏🙏😞😞😞😞😞","2: Flaps weren't down, spoilers not deployed, gear not down... sounds like the engine explosion damaged the hydraulics severely. \n\nOr the less likely possibility is that these pilots were severely under-trained and became overwhelmed due to the emergency?","3: Its BOEING !!!!!!","4: Plane seems to be landing at the end of the  runway rather than at the beginning of it. No time for the ground to slow down the Plane.","5: Such bad airport design with that wall at the end of the runway","6: Who puts a concrete wall at the end of the runway?! Like did you not think that a plane may overshoot it and explode?!","7: There are no residential houses behind the concrete barrier. There is only landing lights which are incircled by a fence, a road not heavily trafficked, and what looks like a small,  commercial building at the end before it meets the sea. If that concrete wall, that the commercial airline slammed into wasn't there, the aircraft would have at least 2,400 feet to continue almost unimpeded before it comes to a small single story commercial building (from what I used to measure using the Google earth app), until it stopped. I'm sure nearly everyone on board would have been alive if that concrete barrier was not there.","8: should not have a concrete barrier at the end of the runway!!! totally criminal design!!!","9: So saddend. The Airport in South Korea, Muan Airport, is inherently problematic. Its construction was heavily supported by Democratic Party politicians in South Korea for political reasons-- to get local votes. They said it was projected to serve 9.8 million passengers per year during its planning stages, but the actual annual passenger count has only reached 260,000, approximately 2.5% of the original estimate. Not surprisingly, it has been all-time #1 in deficits. Plus, the airport is located in an area densely surrounded by migratory bird habitats, which has made it particularly vulnerable to bird strikes, ranking #1 in such incidents nationwide. Despite its significant deficits and safety concerns, the airport was constructed to appeal to local voters. This might be an important background for this plane crash, as its condition and preparation are quite different from the major airports like Incheon and Kimpo. Extremely sad news.","10: *bbbeezy* The US is actually the leader as the country with the most fatal civil airplane crashes, not the other way around, you deluded kid 😂","11: Another Boeing 737.

Korea (possible Hydraulic System failure). What's the odd of that? BOEING must have paid a lot of PR for all these so called reporters/experts not to question about BOEING's planes. Especially given, two former BOEING engineer & quality control technician turn whistleblowers exposed frequent Boeing malpractice and they were dead the day before they can testify in court! Enough said!","13: Why would you even put a concrete barrier at the end of a runway? Jesus christ.","14: Why would you drive it into a wall","15: Actually ppl say that the landing gear is stuck","16: When the China passenger plane crashed, some netizens in South Korea gloated that it was a happy day, but I just want to say that as people on earth, I hope everyone will be healthy and avoid all things that they don't want.","17: Boeing... is first problem. \nThe wall is next.","18: looked like the throttles stuck wide open..dont be a robot.when theres endless smooth water 1000 feet away.derp.other footage showes people flying apart like lego people.","19: Typical ABC cutting footage off lol","20: I think this was the plane that Gi-Hun from Squid Game was about go on","21: \"Killing scores\"?

Why weren’t breaks applied ? And could the situation have had less casualties had they decided to land elsewhere, say perhaps , water landing … which then makes me wonder … could the pilot have chosen to not land then and maybe circled or something to buy time before trying to land again ?","24: wow just wow those passengers survived the landing only to be killed by the airport…","25: Big tragedy happed always in the end of t year. That is very frustrating to see. Why there is a concrete wall over there?

Still so many questions.  If I knew my landing gear had failed, I would have lifted back up from the runway and circled the airport, with a request for ground crews to cover the landing strip with fire-dampening foam.  I would also have opted to drain my fuel tanks.  I am merely a bystander, untrained.  Are airline pilots trained to make such decisions?  To ask to circle the airport again?  To empty fuel tanks?  Are ground crews equipped to prep for a hard landing?  It also appeared that the flaps on the wings did not deploy to brake the jet.  Is that a correct assessment?  If so, did the pilot lose power?  So many questions!!!","37: x","38: it didnt crash, it was ripped apart by a solid concrete wall that should never have been there. Airports worldwide must review solid obstacles at the end of runways. This was the fault of the airport builders.","39: i really dont think we should be keeping scores.

It's not about the wall. The wall only became a factor because the plane kept sliding. Of course you are going to have a wall. You need the security on the outer edge of the airport so people don't go for their afternoon walks with their dogs on the tarmac. The problem is why didn't the landing gear come down. The breaks are on the wheels so if the wheels don't come out, there is no breaking.","55: The plane didn’t veer off the runaway. It hit a poured concrete support for the localizer antennaes which are located down the centerline of the runway. \nNormally they’re mounted on a low mass breakaway frame that if hit by a plane would simply breakaway.","56: What the heck 🤬🤦🏽‍♀️","57: This is so incredibly tragic!

Does this program enjoy wasting viewers’ time?","79: The pilot should've known the landing gear wasn't deployed and shouldn't have attempted a landing.  A water landing would've been safer if possible. If the landing gear broke off when impacting the ground, the pilot was likely coming in too fast. Birds wouldn't have caused the landing gear to malfunction like that.  It'll be interesting to see what comes out of the investigation.  Sad nonetheless. People blaming a concrete wall are braindead.  This was VERY likely pilot error.","80: The wall is apparently a military construction and not an aviation thing.","81: Why cant they install huge parachutes at the back of the planes?","82: How come a net on the ground and a landing parachute is not installed on planes?

There's no question about it—you don't land with your landing gear up if you have time to put it down. There's an alternative method even if you've lost all hydraulics. So why did they land with the gear up? Was it a situation where they had another emergency that we don't understand yet in the cockpit, or was there something else—including just forgetting to put it down in the middle of an emergency? And John, another thing that we notice here in this video is that the plane just isn't slowing down even when it's landing on its belly. Some airports have those crush pads at the end of runways. When you look at this and you look at Boeing and people look at other Boeing incidents earlier this year—is this something that you're going to be saying, \"Well, wait a minute; maybe there's a problem with this particular jet?\" Or no, because it's a 15-year-old jet? First of all, the 737 is about probably the most ubiquitous aircraft out there along with Airbus A320. I don't think there's anything that's indicated so far that might be a generic problem with the airplane. Very simple systems, but the thing is until we know exactly what happened in those last few minutes, we really won't know the application. But I would be very surprised if there was anything that was a problem with this particular model aircraft.

Still so many questions.  If I knew my landing gear had failed, I would have lifted back up from the runway and circled the airport, with a request for ground crews to cover the landing strip with fire-dampening foam.  I would also have opted to drain my fuel tanks.  I am merely a bystander, untrained.  Are airline pilots trained to make such decisions?  To ask to circle the airport again?  To empty fuel tanks?  Are ground crews equipped to prep for a hard landing?  It also appeared that the flaps on the wings did not deploy to brake the jet.  Is that a correct assessment?  If so, did the pilot lose power?  So many questions!!!","37: x","38: it didnt crash, it was ripped apart by a solid concrete wall that should never have been there.

What's been described as one of the country's worst aviation disasters, the jet was trying to land at Muan International Airport, which is located in the southwest. Emergency authorities say the Boeing 737 caught fire after veering off the runway and hitting a barrier. JJ Air flight was returning from Bangkok carrying 175 passengers and six crew. The fire agency says two people have been pulled alive from the wreckage. All flights to and from the airport have been cancelled. J Air has issued an apology for the crash. Let's get more on this now from our correspondent Rob McBride, who's in Seoul for us. So, Rob, what's the latest you can tell us? Right, emergency teams are still there dealing with the aftermath of this catastrophic crash as an air investigation obviously gets underway into the causes. But initial reports do seem to suggest that there was some sort of failure of the landing gear on this aircraft. Images show the aircraft skidding basically along the runway on its belly at an uncontrolled speed, going off the end of the runway and then according to authorities hitting a perimeter wall at the airport which then it seems led to a catastrophic explosion. And other images have shown the burning wreckage with very fierce, intense fire breaking out basically throughout the wrecked aircraft. There have also been some reports and images taken from the ground which appear to show—and maybe—a possible bird strike on one of the engines which may have been a contributing factor to this. There's also reports that this had been the second attempt by the aircraft to make a landing; it had actually gone around, so there does seem to have been some ongoing issue with the aircraft—presumably with the landing gear—which then caused this crash landing to take place. The latest casualty figures we have now got is that 85 people are confirmed to have died and so far, we're only hearing about two survivors from the wreckage. One is said to be a cabin member of the cabin crew—a 33-year-old attendant by the name of Lee (the family name of Lee) and also one female passenger in her 20s. They are being taken to Mokpo, which is the nearest large city down in the southwest of South Korea for treatment, but those are the only survivors so far that we are hearing about as the emergency teams deal with the aftermath of this crash. And Rob, what more can you tell us about the airline involved in this? Yeah, Jeju Air is a very well-known airline here in South Korea. It's the largest of the low-cost carriers—one of the first to be established.","comments":["0: It looks like a gear up landing. And they're saying they did a go-around.

You can see this from the light pink color they use as codes and the subsequent impeachment protests after each disaster.

For Jeju Air specifically, this incident could have implications for their reputation and operations moving forward, especially considering they've been trying to position themselves as a reliable budget option in Asia. As for what happens next, there will be an investigation by South Korean authorities, likely with international observers given the global nature of aviation safety standards. The focus will be on determining the cause of the crash, examining maintenance records, pilot training and experience, and any potential mechanical failures. It's a process that can take months or even years to complete. In terms of what this means for passengers flying with Jeju Air or other airlines in the region, it's hard to say at this stage.

Life is eternal.","25: I dont think this is really what happened,  i think the only failure of the landing gear was the failure of the third world pilots to deploy it. A bird stike to the engine has absolutely NOTHING to do with the landing gear not being deployed. No offense to anyone intended but cmon now its a low budget air liner with even lower budget training. i guarantee the pilots simply didnt deploy the gear.","26: Have you wonder 💭 why there was a concrete wall at the end of the runway? This is what killed them. \n\nIt looks like the pilots emergency landed the plane very well to be honest. \n\nIt looks like what actually caused the fire and destruction was the impact against the concrete wall at the end of the runway. \n\nThis is shocking 😮","27: Wow!

Passengers usually dont know a thing. If a survivor could potentially call out exactly what went wrong, manufacturers & airline workers would be forced to do nake changes.

Similar problem took place with Boeing in Warsaw, Poland not long ago.  But the pilots of Polish LOT airline followed all checklist procedures  to save their passengers and nobody was even hurt: circled the airport while dumping all fuel prior to landing and belly landed on a prepared surface which minimized any damage and chances of fire.  All hospitals in the area were notified and firemen waited along the runway.  Here, the videos show that nobody got prepared for his landing.","94: I thought the planes have manual activation of the landing gear in case there's an electrical malfunction.
